**Making Sense and Meaning**
===============

#Abstract
Firstly, I want to note the following abstract is based on my observations. I grew up and learned design in Eastern world, Japan.  The sense that I learned in Japan, design is more recognized as something small in society. Since we have these Shinto based thoughts; everything has gods in it and everything has a meaning in it, it brings up that design is not a solution at all but it can be a small approach to society in some context. I have realized that I am totally embedded with eastern way of thinking since I came here to Barcelona. When I compare it to western way of thinking which is more dedicated to western religions such as having only one god, the way of thinking is more like someone(the god) makes everything with one click. So the design here seems to be more like one thing that makes and solves everything. I often feel this way is a common thing in western world. Because in my opinion, people are having this way of thinking that they believe one design will save the world as it can be a solution even though they know the wicked problems. I feel more comfortable with eastern way of thinking even right now I am studying at IaaC. Though, I still feel like both ways should be fusioned so that it can have an alternative approach to the current state of society in some context.
In this sense, for me design means a way/tool of creating alternatives in living. Design is not the last thing that comes out of the process as an output, it is the process for researching/exploring the world. It gives me some chances to find out how I can live in this world without following what has been there in the system because it is the topic I always want to follow and know.
So that design always helps me to achieve my purpose by bringing opportunities to collaborate with others since it is a process of making/achieving something when I follow something I want to know. When I am designing something, I get to know so many things around me- people and things and that whole thing and process is helping me to achieve my purpose of living alternatively.
