**Making Sense and Meaning**
===============

#Abstract
Firstly, I want to note the following abstract is based on my opinion and observations.I grew up and learned design in western world, Japan. In the sense I learned in Japan, design is more recognized as something small in society. Since we have these Shinto based thoughts; everything has gods in it and everything has a meaning in it, it brings up that design is not a solution at all but it can be a small approach to society in some context. I feel like I am totally embedded with eastern way of thinking since I came here to Barcelona and I compare it to western way of thinking which is more dedicated to western religions with one god. The way of thinking is more like someone(the god) makes things, so the design here seems to be more like one thing that makes and solves things. I often feel this way because in my opinion, people are having this way of thinking that they believe one design thing will save the world as it can be a solution even though they know the wicked problems. I feel more comfortable with eastern way of thinking even right now studying at IaaC. Though, I still feel like both ways should be fusioned so that it can have an alternative approach to the current state of society in the context.
In this sense, for me design means a way/tool of creating alternatives in living. Design is not a last thing that comes out of the process as an output, it is the process for researching/exploring the world. It gives me some chances to find out how I can live in this world without following what has been there in the system because it is the topic I always want to follow and know.
So that design always helps me to achieve my purpose by bringing opportunities to collaborate with others since it is a process of making/achieving something when I follow something I want to know. When I am designing something, I get to know so many things around me- people and things and that whole thing and process is helping me to achieve my purpose of living alternatively.
Also in this case, the design can be used for opening my world wider and deeper to transform it into something in the way that it brings me to realize how I am living in this world with others. Design transforms not the system to solution, but me to process and approach to the context.
