**Atlas of Weak Signals**
===============


This seminar was like going over what I have been learning through our life, because it was literally the reason I came to this master. Climate change, interspecies solidarity, capitalism, internet,AI, politics and nationsâ€¦ All these things are related and cannot be solved - it is a wicked problem as we know. This is why we, as a MDEF student, are seeking weak signals in our life, to catch the signal that we can face and try to fight, even at least for that. To me, all these problems are problems, but I don't know if I can live without them. Yes I want to blame capitalism but it is also the reason I was able to come to IaaC all the way from Japan. Yes I want to blame the internet but it also gives people a connection to the world because I know even indegenous people have smartphones. I don't know what is the truth and what is right. At least to me, these things presented in the class are really based on western point of view. As a person who was born and grew up in eastern island Japan, I would feel these are things western world manipulates the eastern world.

Though, through the seminar, we were able to think more deeply about what I am supposed to be doing. Also reminded me why I came here. I wouldn't take  a way to change a system for a solution like the top down way, but would take a bottom up approach for getting to answer my weak signal.I don't think I can change the world, but I think I can do something small to at least make someone happier.
