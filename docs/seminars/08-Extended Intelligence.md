**Extended Intelligence Nov.30-Dec.10**
===============

These two weeks we learned extended intelligence. 
We first learned about generating images by making datasets. To be honest I actually did not understand the structure or mechanism of this, but at least I learned that we need tons of pictures for the dataset that we are generating an image out of. 
Generating an image means that it can make an image that actually does not exist in reality, so this can be used for the crimes at the same time it is used for creative things.
Though, for the first group work for the idea of generating an image that can speculate something, we thought that it could make and show us the image of a new lifestyle.So we generated the new image of shoes that actually does not exist but can be by capturing membersâ€™ shoes.

Later we learned more about what intelligence really is. I was imagining it is something with mechanics and computational things, but it is not. It is just a collection of information that a thing or creature knows. So for the second group work, we decided to give an intelligence to the table we were sitting at. And made this objective, the table that keeps us awake during the class. We assumed that the table would get those information of brain waves, body movements and the pulse of each student by sensors.

To sum up these seminars, I was not able to get used to the AI or any intelligence that computers have. I would like to learn more about it step by step if I have a chance so I can probably use this skill for my future project. Thought least I was able to get an idea of what extended intelligence is like.
