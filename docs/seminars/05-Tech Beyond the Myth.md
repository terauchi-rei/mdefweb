## Forensic Questions


---

**How does it work?** 
It is a personal computer , used for personal work  like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing.
This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies.
This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet.
It had an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and  3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port
This device could be used for personal use or work.


:::

## Steps taken
First of all we checked if the computer worked. It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. 
We could check that the iMac worked but we couldn‚Äôt check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility.

We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. 

![](../images/techbeyondthemyth/PROCESS2.jpg)

After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system.

![](../images/techbeyondthemyth/PROCESS4.jpg)


From this step it was all based on the electronic system behind the computer. We disassembled the motherboard and other components such as hard drive, heat sink, CD lector...

## Results
Q.How many motors we find inside, does it contain a computer or microcontroller?
3 motors.  It contains a microcontroller.

Q.Did the appliance fail, why?
It was properly working when we turned it on.

Q.Did the appliance failed?Why?
This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is  the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible  to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone.
Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use.


---

## Conclusions
It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in.

Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. 

Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. 

When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it's open.

There are more than 100 screws used inside.

Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both manufactured by stamping, the stand might be molded. 

Plastic parts(box) are coated polycarbonate.

Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation.

Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore.


## Opinions
 At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer

The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits,  so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder
The body  it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward.

There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws.

We can also find a few metals for heat displacement like aluminum and copper.

There are also tiny plastic parts that make the connection to the back part of the computer and the boards or the optical unit to the lateral of the computer.

### Project Goals
**Objective:** 
I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC.

**Question:** 
Are all spaces in IAAC in use at lunch time?

 **Hypothesis:** 
- Lunch&Afternoon Data
"There is a space for a (covid-safe) lunch?"
- Morning Data
"Are there people in Iaac interested in having a space to have lunch?"

### Tips

We think we needed more time to think about the question we were going to use, so our strategy of how we recollected the data and defining which tool could work so that the results were more efficient.
We had two topics, so we generated many different ideas to work with each one, so maybe choosing a general one that could have those two ideas covered, was more convenient.

## From hypothesis to data

### Tools selection

![](https://i.imgur.com/xsEUGUi.jpg)



We decided to choose the PiCamera as a tool for the experiment. We thought it would be quite a practical way of checking the availability of IAAC spaces and counting people. However, a physical intervention would have been also an appropriate means to collect data for our case.

### Tool üîß usage documentation:

We used the PiCamera to create timelapses in two different ways:
- POV timelapse: the camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC.
- Static timelapse: the camera was static in a specific place and captured everything that happened there.

For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px) in order not to have heavy files. We also set the photo frequency to 1 picture per second to have enough information from people's movements.

#### Data capturing strategy:

Our strategy consisted of two main points: The first one was based on checking the different spaces of IAAC with the camera during lunchtime and seeing if there was people eating inside. Thanks to this, we could get information for both of our hypothesis.
The second one focused on testing the interest of people around a poster in the entrance communicating a supposed "Lunch Room" at IAAC's main hall. This would let us know about support for this idea.

Also, we had to change the strategy in the middle of the data collection since the PiCamera stopped working. Our intention there was to count the amount of people going to eat outside during lunchtime compared to the total of people at IAAC. However, we believe this wasn't a major problem for our research.

#### Materials needed:

Picamera, "LunchRoom" poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms.

#### Data collected

Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc.

For privacy reasons we are not able to show the images captured by the Raspberry Pi. Two impressions of the data generated shown below.

#### Tips

It was hard to analyze what is happening in the captured timelapse data because the camera took pictures every 3 seconds only, so there were things that the camera was not able to capture. Also, we chosed to make the resolution of the data low and it gave us a hard time to analyze things in the timelapse especially for the static one. We would change how the data is captured and output rather than changing how we collect the data.

### Data insights
![](https://i.imgur.com/JMpI1qZ.jpg)

:::warning
A hypothesis may be testable, but even that isn‚Äôt enough for it to be a scientific hypothesis. In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Proving it's true it will require testing all possible combinations, that's hard, maybe impossible.
:::

Post at least two images of a chart, a screen-shoot of your data, that you used to prove if your hypothesis is false.

### Tips
We think that in order to recollect more data, we have to do it for more days at the same hour (lunch time) because is not precise just knowing how much people had lunch inside Iaac when we know that the quantity may vary depending on the days. And if we want to know the amount of people that enters Iaac and compared it to the people that eats inside for whatever reason, we need to do it for more days.

**I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC**

Are all spaces in IAAC in use?
Yes, but it depends on the day time.

By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master‚Äôs students but regarding to each students master‚Äôs classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben's body. 
As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen.

After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things.
We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. 

So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a "LunchRoom" fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people‚Äôs reactions and if they were interested on joining.


During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn‚Äôt looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read.
We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn‚Äôt the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn‚Äôt looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch.

This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lucnh time?, how many people don't eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?
