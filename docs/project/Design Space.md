In my work space, I chose weak signals that are related to circular economy, sustainability, and inter-species which are the big topics of the Anthropocene.  I have been doing a project with that in mind for past years.
Though, my actual interest is not thinking about sustainability nor climate change. What I really want to work on is how to make people be aware and take responsibility of living. I thought about this since I realized everything around us, I mean infrastructure and systems are in black box. We do not know what is behind the scenes. That way people will never stop wasting less. People will never stop engaging in the bad part of capitalism. Even if a system changes in a good way, the same bad things will happen again as long as people in a system realize to change how they should be. So basically this is my position.

I have references that are mostly how a designer(or artist) himself/herself goes to see the reality of cases and they find out how to break through it.  I want to see the reality of the cases which I want to work on and take actions as understanding the real needs. This reality includes problems, systems, structures and etc. of certain case.

Ever since I am more comfortable prototyping with myself engaged, I decided to make my compost first. Hoping this can lead to some other kind of ideas beside making a compost kit.
My most preferable prototype method will be “means of inquiry”. My research type is always kind of ethnography and I like to do the probes and sometimes interview.
