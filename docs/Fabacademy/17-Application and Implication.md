**17th Application and Implication **
===============
For the rest of the course, I will do my compost project as continuous work from the past interventions. My project is based on compost, the original theme/goal was to make people start doing their own compost making in their household to deal with food waste. Through interventions and prototypes, we have come to start working  at a community garden in order to make compost making as a daily activity for local people. We have two approaches to archive this compost making habit project, which is community based and network based.
For a community based approach, we are working with a local community garden in Poblenou, where only local Catalan old people are working, to build a co-design compost bin on the field through several workshops. For the network based approach, we are making an online platform where people can start composting on their own, through using open source knowledge and data that we share on it.
I am developing a network based approach since I cannot really communicate with local people in Spanish. I am developing a prototype of the online platform as a website and trying to make some open source data to put on the platform. I am now trying to develop a parametric compost bin design with grasshopper since I have designed one in fabchallenge. I want to make it as parameters for changing size and thickness of the material, and later to put the cutting data layout on the material automatically. I am trying to figure out this as my final project. Also I am working on some biomaterial and electric production to put into open source data. For those, I am also trying to make the fabchallenge sensor that we have developed as my next thing to put out as open source. Biomaterial, I am working to make a bag that can be used for carrying food waste from house to a community garden. For this, in order to make it as open source data,I use food waste and will make really easy methods that everyone can do at their household.
