**1st Week Jan.26**
===============

1st week Jan.26

It was the beginning of Fabacademy, which I was waiting for! As I was unexpecting, it kicked off with git and html. I am not used to any of this, but it is also a good chance for me to start learning. In the beginning of MDEF, I was not really able to get what it is and how it works. Maybe now I can finally make sure and try to do it.

Here are 3 examples from last yearâ€™s MDEF that I like how they document the fabacademy course.

1.[Jose Antonio Uribe](https://jose_uribe.gitlab.io/mdef/pages/fabacademy.html)
I like it because this documentation is based on the linear timeline and I can follow how this person got developed through the course.


2. [Roger Guilemany Casas](https://roger_guilemany.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy.html#faw16)
I like it because this person basically documents everything. Even there is no challenge, he just writes reflections and that I can see how this person felt and improved through the course.


3.[Alejandra Tothill Calvo](https://jana_tothillcalvo.gitlab.io/website/)
I like it because this person really does amazing work for the design. The way of documenting is also interesting that this person embeds some sound files.


I will start working on html by following the steps that lecturers showed us. Within term 2, I will try my best to archive my webpage by making my own one. For that I am sure to take these examples to develop my idea.
