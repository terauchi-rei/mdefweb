In the beginning of MDEF, I was not really able to get what it is and how it works. Maybe now I can finally make sure and try to do it. Here are 3 examples from last year\u2019s MDEF that I like how they document the fabacademy course. 1. Jose Antonio Uribe I like it because this documentation is based on the linear timeline and I can follow how this person got developed through the course. Roger Guilemany Casas I like it because this person basically documents everything. Even there is no challenge, he just writes reflections and that I can see how this person felt and improved through the course. 3. Alejandra Tothill Calvo I like it because this person really does amazing work for the design. The way of documenting is also interesting that this person embeds some sound files. I will start working on html by following the steps that lecturers showed us. Within term 2, I will try my best to archive my webpage by making my own one. For that I am sure to take these examples to develop my idea.","title":"01 introduction"},{"location":"Fabacademy/01-introduction/#1st-week-jan26","text":"1st week Jan.26 It was the beginning of Fabacademy, which I was waiting for!

I am used to design with rhinoceros for 3d modeling but other software is not practical for me. This time, because we had a blender session, I tried to use it as much as I could. I learned the basics so I am not that skillful to design anything with the blender yet, so I tried first to model the coffee cup which could be the easiest for me now. I rendered by trying to put the materials on each part and lights for the rendering. I watched some tutorial videos on Youtube that gently taught me the basic skills. After learning through the coffee cup modeling, I then tried to model something that relates to my project. I modeled the Compotbot which can be a speculation for my project because I am trying to design a compost toolkit sensor now that detects some important information to keep compost healthy. If I had more time and more skills, I want to try modeling sensors that can really work. I am sure I will try it when I am designing a sensor.","title":"02 Computer Aided Design"},{"location":"Fabacademy/02-Computer%20Aided%20Design/#2nd-week-feb7-computer-aided-design","text":"This week we learned computer aided design.

Mostly learned basic skills and knowledge about how to use a laser cutter and by using this what we can make. From last week\u2019s task, I learned how to design with 3d modeling softwares, I used rhinoceros to design my thing to laser cut. I designed a box that opens in the middle like a ring box. When I was about to print my data, I have recognized the material (MDF) was not as thick as I designed.(the wrong information was on the webpage) I almost cried in tears but I truly learned that I have to measure the material before I design. Also, somehow my way of designing intersections was not great, I had to fix it again before cutting. While this happened, Santi told me that he had seen a website that can parametrically generate a box that looks exactly like I designed. That time I did not have enough time for print,(the booking system was messed up and I only had 5 mins to do)I chose to download the generator design and printed it. I don\u2019t think that it was a waste of time because designing is important and teaches us a lot of things, but for the easy prototyping or something like that I would rather choose something open source. Many sad things happened, though I learned a lot too.","title":"03 Computer controlled cutting"},{"location":"Fabacademy/03-Computer-controlled%20cutting/#3rd-week-feb9-computer-controlled-cutting","text":"This week we learned about laser cutting.

I was familiar with 3D printing since uni, though it was my first time printing on my own. I wanted to make my first printing related to the design intervention I am working on. Though I did not come up with any idea and I just thought if I could use this time for mending the cloth, which is a jacket that has lost its button. I modeled a button and booked a 3D printer. I actually booked an Ender for printing, but somehow the booking system was messed up and I was not able to use the one I booked. So I used ANYCUBIC. When I tried to use it, it was not working properly with the configuration. So with the help of Edu I set up the Z axis. I started to print with high quality and the result was nice. These buttons can be used as they are but I wanted to make biomaterial buttons, so I made a mold with silicon and made pine resin bio material. As I knew it is hard to make holes in the buttons with the mold, so I drilled to make holes after biomaterial became solid. Though pine resin biomaterial is still fragile, most of it broke when I made the holes. Only the one that survived was this one and I used it to mend the jacket. It turned out like this and I sewed it to the jacket which had lost its button.

Both are decentralized ideas and I think it is difficult to control but ideal for making democratic network. For the task, I did it at home with my partner.

I wanted to saw with a sawing machine, though when I tried it, the stings got tangled. I think it is because the material is too thick so it is too hard to saw.

This time I decided not to put the cooking paper, so I directly poured the solution onto the acrylic board. And result was very nice. I this time decided to laser cut the material, since it is an another challenge for me. When I asked Dafne she said it is not ideal to laser cut the biomaterial,but I researched on it and it says it can be done. Though I tried so many test cuts. I first set the parameter too fast, it burnt and melted the edge of the pieces. I then tried with the slow and low power. I was kind of worried if it is going to start the fire, thoigh it worked out.

My project is based on compost, the original theme/goal was to make people start doing their own compost making in their household to deal with food waste. Through interventions and prototypes, we have come to start working at a community garden in order to make compost making as a daily activity for local people. We have two approaches to archive this compost making habit project, which is community based and network based. For this kind of agri or circular related project, there is a lot of community based approach such as Compostaje Comunitario Hortaleza(https://compostajecomunitariohtz.wordpress.com/), ConnectHort, and so many other community gardens. Though there is not much about networking with this topic. The MDEF alumni Pablo Zuloaga was developing Farmacademy for his final project as making distributed programme for teaching agriculture just like fabacademy, but this was only a prototype. Also, IaaC project, Soil Observatory was network based, but this idea was not on distributing knowledge,skills, or open source for normal local citizen. For that I know, making a network on this topic could be meaningful to design. For a community based approach, we are working with a local community garden in Poblenou, where only local Catalan old people are working, to build a co-design compost bin on the field through several workshops. For the network based approach, we are making an online platform where people can start composting on their own, through using open source knowledge and data that we share on it. I am developing a network based approach since I cannot really communicate with local people in Spanish. I am developing a prototype of the online platform as a website and trying to make some open source data to put on the platform. I am now trying to develop a parametric compost bin design with grasshopper since I have designed one in fabchallenge. And will develop some interface with Human UI. I want to make it as parameters for changing size and thickness of the material, and later to put the cutting data layout on the material automatically. I am trying to figure out this as my final project. Also I am working on some biomaterial and electric production to put into open source data. For those, I am also trying to make the fabchallenge sensor that we have developed as my next thing to put out as open source. Biomaterial, I am working to make a bag that can be used for carrying food waste from house to a community garden. For this, in order to make it as open source data,I use food waste and will make really easy methods that everyone can do at their household. I think just doing this approach will not cost anything as long as I use the Wix. or something lik ethat for building a website. Though in the future, if this project works out, I want to open this platform officially with its own server and address, so it will cost more. And networking will probably cost when I approach to other organization to join the network, I probably need to spend some money to push them join. For this platform, I wish people post their own skills,knowledge ,opensource, etc to communicate worldwide. This way, I need to build a system for making people make their account and post. I think this process will not be done for the final project, I hope to develop it afterwards. Also eventhough I set up this platform, it will take so much time for people to use it. I think the duration is the key for this project. How much it will be used is the way that it will be evaluated.But for the final project , I would say the evaluation is done by how I tried build it up. tI also want to answer how to earn money from this project, I guess if it turns out like Precious Plastic, it can be a company where there is distributed groups over the world and I can sell the tool-kit for making compost despite the opensource.","title":"17 Application and Implication"},{"location":"Fabacademy/17-Application%20and%20Implication/#17th-application-and-implication","text":"For the rest of the course, I will do my compost project as continuous work from the past interventions.

How much it will be used is the way that it will be evaluated.But for the final project , I would say the evaluation is done by how I tried build it up. tI also want to answer how to earn money from this project, I guess if it turns out like Precious Plastic, it can be a company where there is distributed groups over the world and I can sell the tool-kit for making compost despite the opensource.","title":"17th Application and Implication"},{"location":"Fabacademy/18-Invention%2CIntellectual%20Property%20and%20Income%20/","text":"18th Intervention,Intellectual Property and Income \u00b6 For dissemination plan, I am thinking of making a website as online platform for compost.

Rei and Emilio were working on the compost intervention, so we easily came to this idea of making part of our intervention related to making a compost toolkit. First Jeremy was also in the group, but eventually separated to do the different things after talking about what we want to make for this challenge. Initial Idea \u00b6 When we started designing, we also had reviews from Guillem, Kate and alumni Pablo for the design intervention and that influenced us to work on this challenge as a prototype for intervention. Since we talked with them, we wanted to develop a compost toolkit sensor that detects some information about the status of the compost such as temperature, humidity, ph, etc.. We discussed focusing on the one feature now to understand how it can be interactive even without using electric sensors, but in an analog way. Gillem advised us to use thermochromic paint which can change its color with the temperature to see how warm the compost gets inside the box. Also to show that and what kind of food waste is thrown away is important because it can lead to the consciousness of waste. We decided to make a transparent compost box for food waste consiousness and making the composting process to be seen Design Process \u00b6 Based on this concept, we decided to build a transparent compost box that has two layers and also has thermochromic features. It is designed for a compost beginner that wants to see what is going on inside and wants to make sure the temperature which indicates the status of compost. 1.Sketch \u00b6 We first drew a sketch, like a really simple one with adding the features. We wanted this compost box with these following features. with a Lid to avoid the smell showing the process air can come in people can look what is inside people can put food waste sieving compost detect temperature change of the compost scaling how much compost decreased 2.Modeling \u00b6 We used Rhinoceros to model. We finalized the design by researching some references. Bio Compostera Digital This is how we finished up designing. As we knew Emilio would leave earlier, so we wanted to keep it simple for Rei to be able to manage everything. It has two layers. The top layer is for decomposing. The bottom layer is used for ready-to-use compost which is sieved from the top layer that has new food waste to decompose. It also dehydrates from the top parts to the bottom. Bottom part can also be used for the plant pot. This compost box can also be a demonstration or exhibition of making awareness of food waste to people because it has a hole on the top so people can look at it. Based on the modeling, we made a cutting data. We made the tolerance for + 0.3 mm. 3.Material \u00b6 Also we wanted to make it transparent to show the inside and the thermochromic color would turn transparent with the heat, so we decided to use acrylic. We actually wanted to use plywood for the back part of the box in order to paint, but there was no plywood that has the same thickness. -3mm Acrylic Board 600x1000mm -thermochromic paint -soil -foodwaste \u203bAll the following is documented by Rei 4. Laser Cutting \u00b6 I tested the joints with acrylic to see how much tolerance should. Then I got to know that it should be less than the thickness of the material because the laser burns it. So I changed the tolerance to -0.1mm. First the parameter was too weak, it did not cut through the board. Then changed the parameter keeping the same power but slower speed. Then it finally cut through. I did the preassembly to make sure if it all fits. It was fine so I then moved to the paint. 5. Paint \u00b6 I used thermochromic paint I bought to apply on the back part of the box. I painted with a brush,(it actually recommended airbrush or spray which I don\u2019t have) I put almost 5 layers by firstly applying the primer on the surface. I also did a test first. It turns transparent when it attaches to something that is 26-31 degrees. I dried it completely and now it is ready to assemble! 6. Assembly \u00b6 I assembled it using a rubber hammer to completely fit the joints. And I put some compost on the top layer. Some soil that is ready to use goes to the bottom . . Now it is ready to use! Learnings \u00b6 -When making cutting data, it is always important to test cut the joints first -When cutting with laser, it is always important to test cut with the parameter -Materials tend to vary the thickness even in the same piece of board -Acrylic is hard to assemble with finger joints that it sometimes cracks the edge -Designing parametrically is necessary for the joint design Next Step \u00b6 Now I placed it on the corner of our class room. So anyone can throw away their food waste from the hole on the lid and mix it with the shovel. It can be interactive as it changes the color on the back part which indicates how active this compost is because active compost increases temperature. I also want to give it to a compost begginer to test how these features can be effective for them to start doing a compose -these features make it easier? Interactive? Understandable? Fun? Based on the reflections to the test, I will develop a new version of a compost box. . .","title":"FabAcademy 1st Challenge Feb.15 18"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%201st%20Challenge%20Feb.15-18/#fabacademy-1st-challenge-feb15-18","text":"Repository is here below: https://github.com/emiliosmith/FabAcademy-challenge by Rei Terauchi & Emilio Smith","title":"FabAcademy 1st Challenge Feb.15-18*"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%201st%20Challenge%20Feb.15-18/#group","text":"We formed a group based on the design intervention.

Since we have been focusing on food waste and compost for the past design interventions, we have wanted to have another approach to it. Actually we were planning to design a hydroponic chair for this time, but when we came to think about the relation and continuation from our design intervention, we thought that we should keep focusing on the food waste topic. Probably we will work on the hydroponic chair another time. (Also we need to figure out arduino stuff to do it) Link to our project \u00b6 For the past few weeks, we have been trying to get engaged in the Poblenou local community, especially those of community gardens and local restaurants in order to make a small circulation in the area. We have been asking if we can get their food waste to make compost in local community gardens to local restaurants, and we have been asking if we can collaborate in making compost for local community gardens. . . Recently we have been in touch with this restaurant just across the street of IaaC called Galega, and the owner is so friendly. He gives us a lot of coffee waste and sometimes bread from the day before. Bread can be printed into something like a cookie we found in the article. We decided to 3D print it and exhibit it at the design dialogue as our different perspective/approach to the food waste and compost topic. Also to exhibit, we have decided to make a stand and a base for the exhibition to put the cookies on and also for the other stuff we have designed already. Additionally we also designed a push cart for carrying waste and soil from one place to another. Because when Galega gives us a big bag of coffee waste, it is super heavy and hard to carry. We both worked together, but Rei mainly focused on 3D printing cooking, Emilio mainly designed modeling for CNC. Fabrication Process \u00b6 <3D PRINTING COOKIE> \u00b6 This time we used bread from Galega. We actually tried the test with pasta which Emilio found in his kitchen, probably from a long time ago. We first boiled the pasta with a bit of salt and smashed it with a blender into a dense paste. We tested with a cylinder if this paste is thick enough to extrude. Once the paste looked fine and tasted fine, we put it into the cylinder for the 3D printer. We tried the test printing with a small circle. . . . It was okay for the first time but as the paste got more dense as it dried out, it became much harder to extrude because it stuck in the extruder. . . Learning from this, we decided to make bread paste a little bit loose. . First we tried a circle and it went well for several layers. . After that we tried to make our own design of a cookie. . . . Somehow there was something wrong with the code, the paste mixer of the 3D printer did not mix, we fixed it on grasshopper and it extruded constantly. . . This is how cookies look and we tried some of them baked in the oven. Emilio tried it and said it is not bad. . . . \u00b6 We designed them from a sketch and into 3d modeling with Rhino, and cut them with CNC. It was our first time using CNC at IaaC. . . . . We designed several different things for the exhibition. One table, two stands, and one push cart. We made the data carefully by checking the tolerance and diameter of the pockets. . Problems \u00b6 For 3D printing -The paste of the food waste easily gets thicker so it gets stuck with the extruder. We added more water to manage it. -The mixer of a 3D printer stopped mixing the paste. We changed the code in grasshopper to manage it. -When we tried to print the complex design, the extruder squished the printed paste because it went over the same paths. We thought we needed to model the design that each path goes on the top of another so the extruder will not go on to the other path. -Printed paste dried but cracked easily, there needs to be something flexible for the recipe to make paste. . -Maybe normal shapes can be just made with a mold. For CNC -It is always hard to check the right tolerance before cutting. Also it should be faster to manage that by using grasshopper, we want to try that. - Even If only one cutting data is wrong, we need to cut it again. -It takes super long time for engraving and cutting. Future Development \u00b6 We thought 3D printing food waste is capable of giving us a new perspective in dealing with food waste and compost. Usually wasted food doesn\u2019t look attractive at all so no one eats it, but when it is printed with a 3D printer, it looks attractive so people would eat it. It can be an interesting fact that people will think of food waste as something edible and also for waste consiousness. We want to try to make more complex shapes and a variety of food waste paste to develop this project. To do that, we want to make something that actually makes food waste printed taste good and develop a recipe for open source.

When we talk about compost making, we are lacking inputs to know if we are doing well or not if we are not used to work with soil and plants. With that in mind, it is needed to design something that can give a lecture and create an output of information that could be available for a community and in that way activate the participation. We intend to use this concept to design an interaction between sensors that can be connected to the soil or the compost in order to connect to the people in the community and have a social action and integration in the task that benefits all. Process \u00b6 Humidity sensor sharing data Soil Mixer connected to wifi/moving with heat generated energy Humidity sensor \u00b6 This time we tried to use the humidity sensor connected to wifi, in order to make your phone showing the percentage of humidity whenever you connect to the page. It detects the humidity at every certain time that you control by arduino. First, we have this water pump kit that we wanted to use in order to automatically control the humidity of plants/compost. In theory, if we have this on, we will not let the plants die. We killed some plants when we left them over the holidays. We first planned to have this dream image. Somehow we wanted to pursue the way that we share collected data community wise since we are engaged in this community garden in Poblenou. Emilio tried hard to control this humidity sensor using an arduino IDE for the CPU we had of ESP32. So many problems happened through this process because the sensor gives the random numbers which indicate the voltage that sensor senses. So it was hard to convert them into the number of percentages. Also, the percentage was somehow backward of the actual number. So it was also hard to fix it how it is supposed to be. In the end, it is connected to the rechargeable battery to be on its own so it doesn\u2019t have to be connected to a computer. With a 3d printed case for both battery and the CPU, it can be embedded in the soil of plants/compost. While printing, Emilio worked on the Html to visualize the percentage in a nicer way to show information. !! It is still in the process. Now printing. Soil Mixer \u00b6 Firstly we wanted to use peltiers to generate electricity with the heat of compost. So we tried how it works and at which degrees of temperature that it can generate electricity. It is called waste heat power generation. We first tried with the motor, heating up the peltier with a heat gun, also checking the temperature with a thermometer. It looks like it(one peltier) can move the motor at 60 degrees. While leaving some soil outside under sun with the acrylic sphere cover, it reaches 35 degrees or more. In theory, the website says that it can reach up to 65 degrees. The peltier I got was this.Max 12 volts and 6A. Then I tried to move the water pump that requires 3 or 5 volts. I connected two peltiers to generate electricity that must be enough to turn on the water pump. Though it didn\u2019t work. So there needs to be more voltage or amperage. Rei checked up how much the water pump requires to move, then there should be 3v with amperage of or 1.5v with more than 200 amperage. Rei tried to connect peltiers in both parallel / linear to solve this but it didn\u2019t move. In the end, with only 2 peltiers, it is impossible to generate enough energy to make a water pump work. So Rei decided not to use the water pump this time. Victor introduced the Stirling engine which we want to try next time. Peltiers moved the motor, so we decided to use the motor for the soil mixer. So probably we can control the compost mixer with its heat. We first set up this breadboard work, for making a motor work with the light so we can later change the protocol to make it work with the heat and with the peltier. Though, somehow it didn\u2019t work even with the computer. So we are stuck here. At one time, we 3d printed a mixer propeller so it can be attached to the motor. Problems \u00b6 -the sensor was not stable. We struggled to figure out the sensor was properly working. -it was the first time using peltiers to work, and we didn\u2019t find any examples using peltiers for arduino projects. Probably it is not ideal to use for electricity. -No time to fabricate the artifacts. -Arduino problems with Mac computers? Learning \u00b6 -practicality of sensors -the amperage and voltage -electricity that is produced and consumed at a time -usage of the sensors Future Development \u00b6 We will try to finish the artifacts as soon as we figure it out. First, we will finish the sensor embedded in the compost and will have the soil mixer ready. For the soil mixer, we want to connect it to the phone via wifi so it is available for controlling on/off online.

When we talk about compost making, we are lacking inputs to know if we are doing well or not if we are not used to work with soil and plants. With that in mind, it is needed to design something that can give a lecture and create an output of information that could be available for a community and in that way activate the participation. We intend to use this concept to design an interaction between sensors that can be connected to the soil or the compost in order to connect to the people in the community and have a social action and integration in the task that benefits all.","title":"Objective"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%20Challenge%203rd/#process","text":"Humidity sensor sharing data Soil Mixer connected to wifi/moving with heat generated energy","title":"Process"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%20Challenge%203rd/#humidity-sensor","text":"This time we tried to use the humidity sensor connected to wifi, in order to make your phone showing the percentage of humidity whenever you connect to the page. It detects the humidity at every certain time that you control by arduino. First, we have this water pump kit that we wanted to use in order to automatically control the humidity of plants/compost. In theory, if we have this on, we will not let the plants die. We killed some plants when we left them over the holidays. We first planned to have this dream image. Somehow we wanted to pursue the way that we share collected data community wise since we are engaged in this community garden in Poblenou. Emilio tried hard to control this humidity sensor using an arduino IDE for the CPU we had of ESP32. So many problems happened through this process because the sensor gives the random numbers which indicate the voltage that sensor senses. So it was hard to convert them into the number of percentages. Also, the percentage was somehow backward of the actual number. So it was also hard to fix it how it is supposed to be. In the end, it is connected to the rechargeable battery to be on its own so it doesn\u2019t have to be connected to a computer. With a 3d printed case for both battery and the CPU, it can be embedded in the soil of plants/compost. While printing, Emilio worked on the Html to visualize the percentage in a nicer way to show information. !! It is still in the process. Now printing.","title":"Humidity sensor"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%20Challenge%203rd/#soil-mixer","text":"Firstly we wanted to use peltiers to generate electricity with the heat of compost. So we tried how it works and at which degrees of temperature that it can generate electricity. It is called waste heat power generation. We first tried with the motor, heating up the peltier with a heat gun, also checking the temperature with a thermometer. It looks like it(one peltier) can move the motor at 60 degrees. While leaving some soil outside under sun with the acrylic sphere cover, it reaches 35 degrees or more. In theory, the website says that it can reach up to 65 degrees. The peltier I got was this.Max 12 volts and 6A. Then I tried to move the water pump that requires 3 or 5 volts. I connected two peltiers to generate electricity that must be enough to turn on the water pump. Though it didn\u2019t work. So there needs to be more voltage or amperage. Rei checked up how much the water pump requires to move, then there should be 3v with amperage of or 1.5v with more than 200 amperage. Rei tried to connect peltiers in both parallel / linear to solve this but it didn\u2019t move. In the end, with only 2 peltiers, it is impossible to generate enough energy to make a water pump work. So Rei decided not to use the water pump this time. Victor introduced the Stirling engine which we want to try next time. Peltiers moved the motor, so we decided to use the motor for the soil mixer. So probably we can control the compost mixer with its heat. We first set up this breadboard work, for making a motor work with the light so we can later change the protocol to make it work with the heat and with the peltier. Though, somehow it didn\u2019t work even with the computer. So we are stuck here. At one time, we 3d printed a mixer propeller so it can be attached to the motor.","title":"Soil Mixer"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%20Challenge%203rd/#problems","text":"-the sensor was not stable.

Our compost final project has two approaches now and we are working separately to archive the goal. The one approach is community level, making a co-design compost bin in a local community garden in Poblenou with super local people. The other approach is platform level, making online platform to make compost networks over the world, where people can share open source knowledge and skills. In our theory, by developing these both approaches will lead us to accomplish the compost making as people\u2019s daily activity by introducing small and big perspectives. Process \u00b6 Compost Bin Lid Compost Bin Parameter So we did two different things so there are two different processes. Hehe below shows how we worked on our own things to do. Firstly we had this agenda of trying to make these things as examples. Compost Bin Lid \u00b6 \u2013> this repository Compost Bin Parameter \u00b6 For this process, I have wanted to make a open source compost bin data with parameters, so people can adjust it to their cases and download to build their own one for household composting. We designed a compost bin for the first fabchallenge, and I wanted to use it for the open source data. Though I needed to learn grasshopper from zero to build one complete data, so I started with a simple box with finger joints. Also our compost bin design will be only capable for laser cut process, so I think finger joints will be more wide in the making process. I imaged that it will look exactly like this. I tried to follow the instruction by doing some other examples in grasshopper, and I managed to do the box with finger joints. Here you can change the box size, box height, wall thickness, number of joints, and fillet size. Though the bottom part is not finger jointed to the box, I still have this part to work on. This below is the whole grasshopper components I built. It changes by parameters just like this. Then I moved on to the interface building. First I tried to use ShapeDiver. I tried to upload my .gh File, though my free subscription is not enough to upload a file that I made because it took more than 10 seconds to open. In order to process this data, I needed to pay so much money for the subscription so I gave up on using ShapeDiver. Next I used Human Ui, A plugging for grasshopper. This plugin is only available in windows OS, so I downloaded the parallel to operate it. I tried to make an interface as a window with human UI plugin, but I finally did not proceed it. It shows a Window with parameters that you can change and there is a model. Though it doesn\u2019t change the 3d model in the window nor it shows the whole 3d model. I thinks there is something wrong with the mesh making. I will try to figure it out. Problems \u00b6 -Grasshopper is a good source of making parametric design, but sometimes it takes more time to build components than just modeling. -Human UI plugin is useful but operation system matters is a problem when making open source. - Learning \u00b6 -Parameter is really easy to change the data, but making parameter is hard. -these is so many grasshopper (or rhino) plugins that we can download for free, it is superior if you know about plugins, otherwise you have to take more steps to build up parameters Future Development \u00b6 -will try to develop more and make parameter for different types of compost bin. -Also want to make parameter for the layout of cutting data of compost bin. It is always hard and taking time to layout pieces in the material size. -There will also be a need of making tolerance parameter in the cutting data.","title":"FabAcademy Challenge 4th"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%20Challenge%204th/#4th-fabacademy-challenge","text":"by Rei Terauchi & Emilio Smith","title":"4th Fabacademy Challenge*"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%20Challenge%204th/#objective","text":"The objective this time is to make some progress to complete our final project.

Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago? I chose Inter-species Collaboration.

What we learned in the class was basically the basics of biology and agriculture. We had a lot of hands-on experiments and learning of basic contents. First week we learned about what biology is and the first thing we started off with was growing baterias in a container, which is bacteria we got from around IaaC. I rubbed a tree surface and my iPhone and rubbed medium in a container. As time passes, I have noticed , in this world there are microorganisms/bacterias everywhere. This is why we really need to wash or sanitize our hands now. The other day we learned about spirulina and tried to grow it. Though it is hard to grow it( and it is why spirulina was only growing in specific places in the world). It will be a savior to the world of hunger if many people are really able to grow it everywhere.Though I did not find any difference than taking a capsule of proteins or minerals. We also tried growing our own kombucha in a small pot and learned how fermentation processes. Now a pot is at my home and scoby seems to be growing little by little. Also we learned how to use microscopes and how it works. As we learned how to use microscopes, our perspective also got micro. I feel like I can think about things on a micro scale now so that is how I am now interested in the world of microorganisms in soil. Second week was much about agriculture(+biology combined). What I enjoyed the most is about soil, how it is specified in types and circular systems flows. I was not able to see soil using a microscope, though when I saw it with a digital microscope, even only one scoop of soil had many things in it. I felt it was some kind of galaxy. The lecture ended with bioplastic cooking. My group followed the direction and recipe which was shown by teachers though it did not get thick, it was a failure.

In conclusion, it was both doable and cheaper in comparison to other systems so that heat from compost is a realistic solution for nowadays energy problems. What I learned \u00b6 I was originally interested in compost since undergrad and had been making compost for the past two years. I was always thinking of how we can actually turn compost into something reusable because there are not many ways to reuse it. Only we can come up with is to use compost as fertilizer. Though, not many people actually grow plants nor use compost. ( I hope I also want to work on this problem too) Then I found this article that compost makes energy. This paper was talking about the system of making compost energy, though as a designer I want to design something that everyone can get involved in this process of producing energy through composting. Since my objective is why everything around my life is in black box, I think everyone should be more responsible for at least something and they should be involved in the system. This made me think that compost energy can be a tool or platform for people who compost at home and produce energy for their use at home and I now want to design it just like the example of Precious Plastic. Hypothetical Designed Organism \u00b6 As above, I am interested in microorganisms in the compost. It is said effective microorganisms are fermenting bacteria, actinomycetes, and, basidiomycota. You can get them from fallen leaves or organic food waste. Though it is hard to keep them active to make compost hot enough. I guess so I need to design a microorganism that can be fully effective to composting as itself only. I guess mushrooms is something that can most likely to be the one that has those three bacterias. Mushrooms are growing as they are biodegrading organic stuff around it by using enzymes they are producing. Mushrooms are basidiomycota. If I put them in water for several days to start fermentation, would they have both fermenting bacteria and actinomycetes?","title":"03 Bio&Agri Zero"},{"location":"Term1/03-Bio%26Agri%20Zero/#bioagri-zero-oct19-29","text":"These last two weeks we have been exploring the possibilities of biology and agriculture especially in the design field. What we learned in the class was basically the basics of biology and agriculture. We had a lot of hands-on experiments and learning of basic contents. First week we learned about what biology is and the first thing we started off with was growing baterias in a container, which is bacteria we got from around IaaC. I rubbed a tree surface and my iPhone and rubbed medium in a container. As time passes, I have noticed , in this world there are microorganisms/bacterias everywhere. This is why we really need to wash or sanitize our hands now. The other day we learned about spirulina and tried to grow it. Though it is hard to grow it( and it is why spirulina was only growing in specific places in the world). It will be a savior to the world of hunger if many people are really able to grow it everywhere.Though I did not find any difference than taking a capsule of proteins or minerals. We also tried growing our own kombucha in a small pot and learned how fermentation processes. Now a pot is at my home and scoby seems to be growing little by little. Also we learned how to use microscopes and how it works. As we learned how to use microscopes, our perspective also got micro. I feel like I can think about things on a micro scale now so that is how I am now interested in the world of microorganisms in soil. Second week was much about agriculture(+biology combined). What I enjoyed the most is about soil, how it is specified in types and circular systems flows. I was not able to see soil using a microscope, though when I saw it with a digital microscope, even only one scoop of soil had many things in it. I felt it was some kind of galaxy. The lecture ended with bioplastic cooking. My group followed the direction and recipe which was shown by teachers though it did not get thick, it was a failure.

It is a personal computer , used for personal work like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing. This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies. This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet. It had an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and 3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port This device could be used for personal use or work. ::: Steps taken \u00b6 First of all we checked if the computer worked. It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. We could check that the iMac worked but we couldn\u2019t check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility. We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system. From this step it was all based on the electronic system behind the computer. We disassembled the motherboard and other components such as hard drive, heat sink, CD lector\u2026 Details of some components: Datasheet for the logicboard (motherboard) http://www.barebonekit.net/apple-imac-a1195-820-1960-a-logic-board_i_mballpe8201960a.aspx Results \u00b6 Q.How many motors we find inside, does it contain a computer or microcontroller? 3 motors. It contains a microcontroller. Q.Did the appliance fail, why? It was properly working when we turned it on. Q.Did the appliance failed?Why? This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone. Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use. Conclusions \u00b6 It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in. Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it\u2019s open. There are more than 100 screws used inside. Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both manufactured by stamping, the stand might be molded. Plastic parts(box) are coated polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore. Opinions \u00b6 At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits, so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder The body it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward. There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws. We can also find a few metals for heat displacement like aluminum and copper. There are also tiny plastic parts that make the connection to the back part of the computer and the boards or the optical unit to the lateral of the computer.

Question: Are all spaces in IAAC in use at lunch time? Hypothesis: - Lunch&Afternoon Data \u201cThere is a space for a (covid-safe) lunch?\u201d - Morning Data \u201cAre there people in Iaac interested in having a space to have lunch?\u201d Tips \u00b6 We think we needed more time to think about the question we were going to use, so our strategy of how we recollected the data and defining which tool could work so that the results were more efficient. We had two topics, so we generated many different ideas to work with each one, so maybe choosing a general one that could have those two ideas covered, was more convenient. From hypothesis to data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We decided to choose the PiCamera as a tool for the experiment. We thought it would be quite a practical way of checking the availability of IAAC spaces and counting people. However, a physical intervention would have been also an appropriate means to collect data for our case. Tool \ud83d\udd27 usage documentation: \u00b6 We used the PiCamera to create timelapses in two different ways: - POV timelapse: the camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC. - Static timelapse: the camera was static in a specific place and captured everything that happened there. For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px) in order not to have heavy files. We also set the photo frequency to 1 picture per second to have enough information from people\u2019s movements. Data capturing strategy: \u00b6 Our strategy consisted of two main points: The first one was based on checking the different spaces of IAAC with the camera during lunchtime and seeing if there was people eating inside. Thanks to this, we could get information for both of our hypothesis. The second one focused on testing the interest of people around a poster in the entrance communicating a supposed \u201cLunch Room\u201d at IAAC\u2019s main hall. This would let us know about support for this idea. Also, we had to change the strategy in the middle of the data collection since the PiCamera stopped working. Our intention there was to count the amount of people going to eat outside during lunchtime compared to the total of people at IAAC. However, we believe this wasn\u2019t a major problem for our research. Materials needed: \u00b6 Picamera, \u201cLunchRoom\u201d poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms. Detail setup instructions: \u00b6 Data collected \u00b6 Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc. For privacy reasons we are not able to show the images captured by the Raspberry Pi. Two impressions of the data generated shown below. \u201cWhere people are eating lunch inside IAAC building \u201c: \u201cPeople that was interested in the Lunch room poster\u201d: Video recorded with the PiCamera Tips \u00b6 It was hard to analyze what is happening in the captured timelapse data because the camera took pictures every 3 seconds only, so there were things that the camera was not able to capture. Also, we chosed to make the resolution of the data low and it gave us a hard time to analyze things in the timelapse especially for the static one. We would change how the data is captured and output rather than changing how we collect the data.

In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Proving it\u2019s true it will require testing all possible combinations, that\u2019s hard, maybe impossible. ::: Post at least two images of a chart, a screen-shoot of your data, that you used to prove if your hypothesis is false. Tips \u00b6 We think that in order to recollect more data, we have to do it for more days at the same hour (lunch time) because is not precise just knowing how much people had lunch inside Iaac when we know that the quantity may vary depending on the days. And if we want to know the amount of people that enters Iaac and compared it to the people that eats inside for whatever reason, we need to do it for more days. I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lucnh time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"05 Forensic Report & Measuring the World "},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#tech-beyond-the-myth-first-week-nov8-12","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond thE Myth first week Nov.8-12"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#forensic-report-imac-2006","text":"Identity of the reporting agency MDEF Case identifier MDEF//21-22_Tech_beyond_the_myth Identity of the submitter iMac Destructor Date of receipt 09/11/2021 Date of report 09/11/2021 Identity and signature of the examiner Emilio,Fioella,Andrea,Rei","title":"Forensic Report: iMac 2006"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#examination","text":"serial number: CK6s0083WH4 Brand: Apple (in California) Model: A1195 apple computer Color: White Assembled in: China Specifications: 1.83/2x512/160 combo/Esp 2006 Tested: Working :::","title":"Examination"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#forensic-questions","text":"How does it work?

And if we want to know the amount of people that enters Iaac and compared it to the people that eats inside for whatever reason, we need to do it for more days. I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lucnh time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"Tips"},{"location":"Term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/","text":"Tech Beyond thE Myth first week Nov.8-20 \u00b6 These last two weeks have been about techs which I thought I would have a tough time. Result is I had so much fun. Documentation Firstly we disassembled the machine in order to see what is inside and analyze the maker\u2019s strategies. When we opened the iMac 2006 which was the 2nd generation iMac ever made, we found a lot of Apple\u2019s strategic design. (Which is also capitalism point of view) Basically Apple products are not allowing users to fix or touch product mechanics. They have the point to keep users patient to buy their next products coming out. If a user ever fixes or touches inside their product, Apple will never help supporting them. BUT how do they get to know if a user touches or not? That was what we found inside the iMac, basically everything inside was covered with aluminium sheet and that was for detecting heat and radiation but also for this- because a user cannot see things inside by tearing it. That really made me think Apple is really good at marketing and design for gaining more money from customers. Recently, they have announced that they will be selling some parts for iphones to let users fix by themselves. Though, I still think there are some strategies behind it. First half of the week we also did learn data collecting methods. There are several devices they introduced us to collect data- Smart Citizen Kit, Pi Camera, Light Sensor, and Web Scraping. My group chose a Pi Camera and collected data by placing it at one point and putting it on a body to walk around. My group had these following as a set of ideas.

Sadly my opinion was rejected in the group and so we tried to capture where we can eat by putting the camera on a body to walk around. In the end I kind of realized that a camera is basically only good for capturing at one specific place in order to get precise data. We only had one camera that time which means we were not able to collect data that is using cameras advantage of surveillance without interacting.

What was hard for the process of making is prototyping takes so much time when making data into a physical model. Even if it looked okay in the data, it is actually not in reality.

Agar agar \u00b6 How: We selected the additives and grinded 2.Weight and write quantities. 3.we put the fabric sandwiched by the frame 4.we pour water in agar in the pot We put the pot on fire till the boiling point. 6.we put the pot down the fire and put glycerin and vinegar 7.we put the eggshells and pigment 8.we pour the the thing into the frame 9.let it dry 1)eggshells 10 grs. Agar 200 ml. Water 2 ml. Glycerin 2 ml. Vinegar 2 spoons of eggshell 1 pinch of blue powder pigment We chose eggshells for the first try because it was the one that we had for a huge amount. The result was not that beautiful. I was expecting it to be more bright blue, but it seems like gray. I was kind of sad. 2)coffee 10 grs. Agar 200 ml. Water 2 ml. Glycerin 2 ml. Vinegar 2 spoons of coffee We then tried with the coffee which we got tons from a cafeteria. I don\u2019t know why, but it seems to be not that useful when it is dried. Maybe the color is not cool. 3)crab shell 10 grs. Agar 200 ml. Water 2 ml. Glycerin 2 ml. Vinegar 2 spoons of crab shell 1 pinch of red powder pigment This crab shell is what I brought from my house. I didn\u2019t know what to do, but it smells like the sea and stinks. I wanted to get rid of it, but I didn\u2019t know how. Just followed the instructions and the result was fine. But when it dried, it shrank and cracked. Maybe I needed to add more additives. My group has made a mistake to put it on a big mold that did not make liquids enough to reach to the edge otherwise it shrank and cracked after when it is dried. Alginate \u00b6 How: 1.We chose additives and grinded 2.weight and write quantities We prepared the frame with the thick fabric 4.we sprayed the calcium chloride on the frame and fabric We mixed the ingredients except the additives 6.we take some solution with the cylinder 7.we added additives and poured into the frame 8.we sprayed the calcium chloride on the solution We let it dry 1)eggshells 12.5 grs. Alginate 500 ml. Water 30 ml. Glycerin 3 spoons of eggshell 2 pinch of blue powder pigment 1 pinch of unicorn glitter Calcium chloride solution 30 grs. With 500 ml. of H2O It was also that we tried the eggshell with blue pigment. It also turned out gray. Maybe eggshell with blue is not a good combination for the color.I liked how we spray and it turns solid. 2)orange peel 12.5 grs. Alginate 500 ml. Water 30 ml. Glycerin 3 spoons of orange peel 2 pinch of green powder pigment 1 pinch of unicorn glitter Calcium chloride solution 30 grs. With 500 ml. of H2O It was nicer that orange peel adds the color of orange to the biomaterial itself. I like this one the most. Also the bio yarn was fun to make because we gently pushed the cylinder to pour the solution into the calcium chloride. It was a bit difficult for me to keep pushing with the same amount in order to make the yarn the same thickness. I feel like I want to knit something with this. Pine resin \u00b6 How: 1.we chose additives and grinded 2.weight and write quantities 3.we pressed the baking paper on to the mold 4.we put the resin and alcohol in the pot 5.we heated it up until all the resin melt 6.we put the wax to melt 7.we put the pot down from the heat 8.we added additives 9.we pour the solution to the mold 10.we pressed the mold so hard with the baking paper and the lid 1)coffee 45 grs. Pine resin 15 ml. Alcohol 5 grs. Carnauba wax 60 grs. Coffee My group has failed because we put too much coffee which is causing the material to be weak and cracked. 2)eggshell,crabshell,orange peel 45 grs. Pine resin 15 ml. Alcohol 5 grs. Carnauba wax 40 grs. eggshell,crabshell,orange peel This was the last, so we only had a few amount of the additives left except the coffee, so we mixed all the things we had and made one. It turned out orangeish but not that beautiful. I think this pine resin recipe is most useful for making something solid-like a tool. For this pine resin recipe, I kind of learned that the amount of food waste additives differ by the mass of the additives. So after class, when I tried to do it with other molds, I kind of tried to balance to make it not too thick. As we thought this recipe is useful and can make some procult out of it, we decided to develop it by using local wasted additives. Resin Development \u00b6 How: 0.we made a frame with wood. 1.we went to get the additives in the local area and grinded 2.weight and write quantities 3.we pressed the baking paper on to the mold 4.we put the resin and alcohol in the pot 5.we heated it up until all the resin melt 6.we put the wax to melt 7.we put the pot down from the heat 8.we added additives 9.we pour the solution to the mold 10.we pressed the mold so hard with the baking paper and the lid 45 grs. Pine resin 15 ml. Alcohol 5 grs. Carnauba wax 20 grs. Leaves 115 grs. Pine resin 38 ml. Alcohol 12.5 grs. Carnauba wax 75 grs. Flowers This is for the mold we made that can have 1mm thick biomaterial. I still want to figure out how these biomaterials can be solid enough to be a product-like we are trying to make a comb with the recipe above, though it is still too weak to cut out, I think. I want to try making a shovel next time with some food waste biomaterial, I will try to use some other recipe that can stay longer. I mean, I think the idea of biomaterial is for something that does not have to last long. Though I want to make sure if I can make something that lasts longer like a shovel as a product. Also Now I want to try making a fashion item with biomaterial since I realized it is kind of hard to make a solid product with biomaterial. As I saw Suzanne Lee\u2019s bio couture, I want to try making a bioleather. For the cloth I will need a huge container to grow material, but I think for the small accessory like a wallet I can probably try. For doing that, I want to use this recipe as my reference. http://fabtextiles.org/coffee-leather-bag/","title":"02 Remixing Materials First Half"},{"location":"Term2/02-Remixing%20Materials%20First%20Half/#remixing-materials-jan13-27","text":"These last few weeks, I have been working on a biomaterial practice both in class and after class.

We did this as a group with Andrea,Fiorella, and Emillio. work sheet By doing this, we have decided to collect flowers that are usually given to the grave at cemetary. Those flowers are thrown away after turning bad and taken by adjustment cars to the disposal plant. Andrea came up with this idea of making a comb with these flowers, because in Spain women wear the traditional comb at the funeral or mourning. Also we wanted to research some practical way for biomaterial rathar than researching material itself. We first tried to make a biomaterial with these flowers in, with a pine resin recipe. We wanted to cut it for a comb shape but literally we cannot use the cnc machine and it can break. Then we changed our mind to make a mold with a laser and pour biomaterial in. It was too hard to take it out because we didn\u2019t put the wax paper on the mold. Although it was impossible to put it because the mold is too detailed.

I grew up and learned design in Eastern world, Japan. The sense that I learned in Japan, design is more recognized as something small in society. Since we have these Shinto based thoughts; everything has gods in it and everything has a meaning in it, it brings up that design is not a solution at all but it can be a small approach to society in some context. I have realized that I am totally embedded with eastern way of thinking since I came here to Barcelona. When I compare it to western way of thinking which is more dedicated to western religions such as having only one god, the way of thinking is more like someone(the god) makes everything with one click. So the design here seems to be more like one thing that makes and solves everything. I often feel this way is a common thing in western world. Because in my opinion, people are having this way of thinking that they believe one design will save the world as it can be a solution even though they know the wicked problems. I feel more comfortable with eastern way of thinking even right now I am studying at IaaC. Though, I still feel like both ways should be fusioned so that it can have an alternative approach to the current state of society in some context. In this sense, for me design means a way/tool of creating alternatives in living. Design is not the last thing that comes out of the process as an output, it is the process for researching/exploring the world. It gives me some chances to find out how I can live in this world without following what has been there in the system because it is the topic I always want to follow and know. So that design always helps me to achieve my purpose by bringing opportunities to collaborate with others since it is a process of making/achieving something when I follow something I want to know. When I am designing something, I get to know so many things around me- people and things and that whole thing and process is helping me to achieve my purpose of living alternatively. Essay \u00b6 What Design Means for Me? \u00b6 What design means for me? I think, to me, design is a tool that opens up myself to connect to the world and society. It is a communication. It is a connection. It is contextualizing. It sounds like the definition or meaning for graphic design, but I am not talking about it. I am talking about generally what \u201cdesign\u201d means for me. I think this simple explanation is enough for my definition of design or how it means for me in the way I design. I will connect this definition or explanation later on to my perspective towards the design world nowdays. Design in nowdays. I think the design, generally taken by most people, is something that enriches lifestyle such as product design or architectural design that makes concrete three dimensional things with practicalness and beautiness. Also another thing that the design to them is something that makes information useful and simple to be more understood like graphic design. I think only these things are considered \u201cdesign\u201d by most people in the world nowadays, at least in Japan, people tend to recognize design that way. Or they don\u2019t really know about the design industry. Because it is true some designers still pursue to achieve that kind of design, and only those fields of design are praised by people because it is easier to understand. This kind of design recognition still happens especially when those designer communities are really closed and sometimes split from the actual world of the normal citizens. They are probably too privileged to not realize what is happening in this world. Though after some decades those kinds of designers had extreme prosperity with economic growth, we all have come to face this reality where so many problems are tangled and couldn\u2019t ever be solved. Which is now called a wicked problem. The earth is screaming that she cannot hold all humans up anymore, so the climate changes rapidly causing a lot of disasters everywhere. Capitalism has gone too far, now many developed countries are collapsing because of the economic growth that would finally slow down while many social issues happen. Though there are still conflicts and war occurring despite many people talk about diversity, feminism, and racism must be banned. Like now, everyone is talking about different things, suffering at different things. There cannot be one single solution that changes the world or saves people. Some people have come to realize that we should do something for it, instead of only pursuing the way of modern designer dreams. (Sadly there are many left behind designers who only pursue the practicalness and bautiness in design) But I think many designers have been approaching the wicked problem from a variety of perspectives, just like us MDEF students and IaaC people have been trying to do. Looking at an atlas of weak signals, what is the scenario for the future? I, as an MDEF student, have been through this phase to deal with the wicked problem. Through this journey, especially I feel there are two big ways of approaching what designers do to face and deal with the wickedness. Two Approaches to Design \u00b6 One is a big approach such as trying to make the world better by proposing a new system that takes over the previous bad one, or introducing new inventions to make a previous lifestyle change. It is mainly radical and breakthrough for some problems. For example, Fabcity is a big approach that can change peoples lifestyle by introducing digital fabrication skills or methods as well as making fab lab in many different international cities. So the people will have access to making and they can be designers and makers instead of just being as a consumer. This big approach is not really designing one big solution, but designing small nodes to make a whole new network that can make changes in the system. Analyzing and tactically working on a big scale to be effective to wickdness. I think somehow this approach is really western way. I feel IaaC or MDEF wants to raise students to be able to make a big approach as I was asked to be radical in the project. Even though this big approach is not meant to be one big solution, I still feel the design here in western world seems to be more like one thing that makes and solves everything. I often feel this way is a common thing in western world because in my opinion, people are having this way of thinking that they believe one design will save the world as it can be a solution even though they know the wicked problems. I think it is related to religious cultural background in society. Like christiany which only has one god and people believe god created everything, it is natural for people behaving like that way. So I have realized that I feel more comfortable with eastern way of thinking even right now I am studying at IaaC. The other is a small approach such as answering one by one subjects. I think what I have been doing is this approach. It is not making a system nor changing the system. It is more like changing \u201c inside the system\u201d, which is influencing people, or small sectors that play a role in the system. I believe that this way of thinking, which is changing or influencing the small stakeholder in a better way is my purpose of doing design. Because I believe, even if the system changes, the same problem would occur while \u201c inside the system\u201d remains the same. For this I want to point out that actually normal people could really participate in the fabcity movement while they don\u2019t know how to use 3d modeling or even the computer. People could be changed in some way by learning how to use them in order to be a maker or a designer. Though I think not everyone can be a designer nor a maker since there are still some people who don\u2019t own their computer. This approach is more like eastern way for me, facing reality and embodying what we are surrounded by. I want to pursue more of this way, even though I am criticized as not radical. I want to question why it wouldn\u2019t try to help people buy computers first or teach them how to be a designer and a maker without computers. I think it is a small approach and is important for me. Because this is more real to me. What I Want to Do as a Designer \u00b6 Taking the topic back to my definition of design, this is why I am saying design means for me is a tool that opens up myself to connect to the world and society. It is a communication. It is a connection. Being real is always what needs to be communicating and connecting. It is contextualizing. I grew up and learned design in Eastern world, Japan. The sense that I learned in Japan, design is more recognized as something small in society like I said earlier it is only recognized in the field of product design etc. Since Japan has these Shinto based thoughts; everything has gods in it and everything has a meaning in it, it brings up that design is not a solution at all but it can be a small approach to society in some context. I have realized that I am totally embedded with eastern way of thinking since I came here to Barcelona. When I compare it to western way of thinking which is more dedicated to western religions such as having only one god, the way of thinking is more like someone(the god) creates everything with one click. Though, I feel like both ways should be fusioned so that it can have an alternative approach to the current state of society in some context. I want to try integrating both approaches. Critically looking at a big approach and rethinking a small approach like taking good parts from both Eastern way and western way then combining them together. Or sometimes doing both would be really progressive as the project can be. Because for example, gender balance in a group is important, but when it is hard to change the big system (like society) to think gender balance must be equalized or fairly balanced? Some people just need to make a small affirmative action to make gender balance equal at the moment in the group even though not everyone agrees to it. It is important to do both, for while also trying to make the big system (like society) change in order to make the balance equal. So I want to take both approaches for my design project. Currently I am working on the compost project which is to make more people get involved in the process of composting. I am working on a small approach to making a local community garden as a place for composting for neighbors and restaurants in the area by communicating with them. Also designing some open source data of compost bin and compostable bags to let people work on their own by parametrically changing and adjusting to their own cases. (For this, I am not expecting everyone to use their high tech skills, I also want to introduce them how to be low tech and still do it like bricolage with what they have) By doing both approaches, I believe that I can achieve the goal of compost as our companion in urban areas. This is how design can help me achieve my purpose. My purpose of changing or influencing the small stakeholder in a better way could be achieved. So for me, design is not specifically making physical products, architecture, or graphics. Design is not the last thing that comes out of the process as an output, it is the process for researching or exploring the world. It is communicating, connecting, and contextualizing the world. It gives me some chances to find out how I can live in this world without following what has been there in the system because it is the topic I always want to follow and know. So that design always helps me to achieve my purpose by bringing opportunities to collaborate with others since it is a process of making and achieving something when I follow something I want to know. When I am designing something, I get to know so many things around me- people and things and that whole thing and process is helping me to achieve my purpose of living alternatively. In this sense, for me design means a way or a tool of creating alternatives in living as well. How the Design Transforms My World \u00b6 Now, finally going back to writing about my world to transform by design. Firstly, noting my world is like I was, looking for small intersections that I can take a part of to make things better. Because the real world is in a big black box, since everything in our life is not being seen by everyday life, I want to reveal what is inside it. Infrastructure especially is fully in black box. I want to know how and where water comes to my kitchen water tap and to where and how it goes back from my kitchen sink. My world is in black box. It is full of intersections or triggers to open, and I want to see each of them by trying to open. Design, in my sense, can help me do this. Researching through designing and designing through researching. Like what we do in MDEF, that we are able to find atlas of weak signals, I am able to find the key factor to dig into the deep and closed ground of black box to give a small light. By communicating, connecting and contextualizing, which is how I define design, that I am able to at least break one side of a black box. It always requires a long term of time to do though it can transform the world a bit by bit by breaking out the box. So my world will be more open and free while the pre existing systems start to change by what I do to reveal. Design transforms my world by opening and revealing black box that I want to see inside. The process of opening and revealing is the design for me.","title":"04 Making Sense and Meaning"},{"location":"Term2/04-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#making-sense-and-meaning","text":"","title":"Making Sense and Meaning"},{"location":"Term2/04-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#abstract","text":"Firstly, I want to note the following abstract is based on my observations.

In this sense, for me design means a way/tool of creating alternatives in living. Design is not the last thing that comes out of the process as an output, it is the process for researching/exploring the world. It gives me some chances to find out how I can live in this world without following what has been there in the system because it is the topic I always want to follow and know. So that design always helps me to achieve my purpose by bringing opportunities to collaborate with others since it is a process of making/achieving something when I follow something I want to know. When I am designing something, I get to know so many things around me- people and things and that whole thing and process is helping me to achieve my purpose of living alternatively.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"Term2/04-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#essay","text":"","title":"Essay"},{"location":"Term2/04-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#what-design-means-for-me","text":"What design means for me? I think, to me, design is a tool that opens up myself to connect to the world and society. It is a communication. It is a connection. It is contextualizing. It sounds like the definition or meaning for graphic design, but I am not talking about it. I am talking about generally what \u201cdesign\u201d means for me. I think this simple explanation is enough for my definition of design or how it means for me in the way I design. I will connect this definition or explanation later on to my perspective towards the design world nowdays. Design in nowdays. I think the design, generally taken by most people, is something that enriches lifestyle such as product design or architectural design that makes concrete three dimensional things with practicalness and beautiness. Also another thing that the design to them is something that makes information useful and simple to be more understood like graphic design. I think only these things are considered \u201cdesign\u201d by most people in the world nowadays, at least in Japan, people tend to recognize design that way. Or they don\u2019t really know about the design industry. Because it is true some designers still pursue to achieve that kind of design, and only those fields of design are praised by people because it is easier to understand. This kind of design recognition still happens especially when those designer communities are really closed and sometimes split from the actual world of the normal citizens. They are probably too privileged to not realize what is happening in this world. Though after some decades those kinds of designers had extreme prosperity with economic growth, we all have come to face this reality where so many problems are tangled and couldn\u2019t ever be solved. Which is now called a wicked problem. The earth is screaming that she cannot hold all humans up anymore, so the climate changes rapidly causing a lot of disasters everywhere. Capitalism has gone too far, now many developed countries are collapsing because of the economic growth that would finally slow down while many social issues happen. Though there are still conflicts and war occurring despite many people talk about diversity, feminism, and racism must be banned. Like now, everyone is talking about different things, suffering at different things. There cannot be one single solution that changes the world or saves people. Some people have come to realize that we should do something for it, instead of only pursuing the way of modern designer dreams. (Sadly there are many left behind designers who only pursue the practicalness and bautiness in design) But I think many designers have been approaching the wicked problem from a variety of perspectives, just like us MDEF students and IaaC people have been trying to do. Looking at an atlas of weak signals, what is the scenario for the future? I, as an MDEF student, have been through this phase to deal with the wicked problem. Through this journey, especially I feel there are two big ways of approaching what designers do to face and deal with the wickedness.","title":"What Design Means for Me?"},{"location":"Term2/04-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#two-approaches-to-design","text":"One is a big approach such as trying to make the world better by proposing a new system that takes over the previous bad one, or introducing new inventions to make a previous lifestyle change. It is mainly radical and breakthrough for some problems. For example, Fabcity is a big approach that can change peoples lifestyle by introducing digital fabrication skills or methods as well as making fab lab in many different international cities. So the people will have access to making and they can be designers and makers instead of just being as a consumer. This big approach is not really designing one big solution, but designing small nodes to make a whole new network that can make changes in the system. Analyzing and tactically working on a big scale to be effective to wickdness. I think somehow this approach is really western way. I feel IaaC or MDEF wants to raise students to be able to make a big approach as I was asked to be radical in the project. Even though this big approach is not meant to be one big solution, I still feel the design here in western world seems to be more like one thing that makes and solves everything. I often feel this way is a common thing in western world because in my opinion, people are having this way of thinking that they believe one design will save the world as it can be a solution even though they know the wicked problems. I think it is related to religious cultural background in society. Like christiany which only has one god and people believe god created everything, it is natural for people behaving like that way. So I have realized that I feel more comfortable with eastern way of thinking even right now I am studying at IaaC. The other is a small approach such as answering one by one subjects. I think what I have been doing is this approach. It is not making a system nor changing the system. It is more like changing \u201c inside the system\u201d, which is influencing people, or small sectors that play a role in the system. I believe that this way of thinking, which is changing or influencing the small stakeholder in a better way is my purpose of doing design. Because I believe, even if the system changes, the same problem would occur while \u201c inside the system\u201d remains the same. For this I want to point out that actually normal people could really participate in the fabcity movement while they don\u2019t know how to use 3d modeling or even the computer. People could be changed in some way by learning how to use them in order to be a maker or a designer. Though I think not everyone can be a designer nor a maker since there are still some people who don\u2019t own their computer. This approach is more like eastern way for me, facing reality and embodying what we are surrounded by. I want to pursue more of this way, even though I am criticized as not radical. I want to question why it wouldn\u2019t try to help people buy computers first or teach them how to be a designer and a maker without computers. I think it is a small approach and is important for me. Because this is more real to me.","title":"Two Approaches to Design"},{"location":"Term2/04-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#what-i-want-to-do-as-a-designer","text":"Taking the topic back to my definition of design, this is why I am saying design means for me is a tool that opens up myself to connect to the world and society. It is a communication. It is a connection. Being real is always what needs to be communicating and connecting. It is contextualizing. I grew up and learned design in Eastern world, Japan. The sense that I learned in Japan, design is more recognized as something small in society like I said earlier it is only recognized in the field of product design etc. Since Japan has these Shinto based thoughts; everything has gods in it and everything has a meaning in it, it brings up that design is not a solution at all but it can be a small approach to society in some context. I have realized that I am totally embedded with eastern way of thinking since I came here to Barcelona. When I compare it to western way of thinking which is more dedicated to western religions such as having only one god, the way of thinking is more like someone(the god) creates everything with one click. Though, I feel like both ways should be fusioned so that it can have an alternative approach to the current state of society in some context. I want to try integrating both approaches. Critically looking at a big approach and rethinking a small approach like taking good parts from both Eastern way and western way then combining them together. Or sometimes doing both would be really progressive as the project can be. Because for example, gender balance in a group is important, but when it is hard to change the big system (like society) to think gender balance must be equalized or fairly balanced? Some people just need to make a small affirmative action to make gender balance equal at the moment in the group even though not everyone agrees to it. It is important to do both, for while also trying to make the big system (like society) change in order to make the balance equal. So I want to take both approaches for my design project. Currently I am working on the compost project which is to make more people get involved in the process of composting. I am working on a small approach to making a local community garden as a place for composting for neighbors and restaurants in the area by communicating with them. Also designing some open source data of compost bin and compostable bags to let people work on their own by parametrically changing and adjusting to their own cases. (For this, I am not expecting everyone to use their high tech skills, I also want to introduce them how to be low tech and still do it like bricolage with what they have) By doing both approaches, I believe that I can achieve the goal of compost as our companion in urban areas. This is how design can help me achieve my purpose. My purpose of changing or influencing the small stakeholder in a better way could be achieved. So for me, design is not specifically making physical products, architecture, or graphics. Design is not the last thing that comes out of the process as an output, it is the process for researching or exploring the world. It is communicating, connecting, and contextualizing the world. It gives me some chances to find out how I can live in this world without following what has been there in the system because it is the topic I always want to follow and know. So that design always helps me to achieve my purpose by bringing opportunities to collaborate with others since it is a process of making and achieving something when I follow something I want to know. When I am designing something, I get to know so many things around me- people and things and that whole thing and process is helping me to achieve my purpose of living alternatively. In this sense, for me design means a way or a tool of creating alternatives in living as well.","title":"What I Want to Do as a Designer"},{"location":"Term2/04-Making%20Sense%20and%20Meaning/#how-the-design-transforms-my-world","text":"Now, finally going back to writing about my world to transform by design. Firstly, noting my world is like I was, looking for small intersections that I can take a part of to make things better. Because the real world is in a big black box, since everything in our life is not being seen by everyday life, I want to reveal what is inside it. Infrastructure especially is fully in black box. I want to know how and where water comes to my kitchen water tap and to where and how it goes back from my kitchen sink. My world is in black box. It is full of intersections or triggers to open, and I want to see each of them by trying to open. Design, in my sense, can help me do this. Researching through designing and designing through researching. Like what we do in MDEF, that we are able to find atlas of weak signals, I am able to find the key factor to dig into the deep and closed ground of black box to give a small light. By communicating, connecting and contextualizing, which is how I define design, that I am able to at least break one side of a black box. It always requires a long term of time to do though it can transform the world a bit by bit by breaking out the box. So my world will be more open and free while the pre existing systems start to change by what I do to reveal. Design transforms my world by opening and revealing black box that I want to see inside.

I always was feeling this dilemma as a designer to have what kind of ethics I should follow. Though through these classes I think I am more comfortable with what I honestly feel. I learned three different ethical ways of thinking in this class. It is how technology can be used in design, how designers should act as a person who has a will and ego, and how professional designers should design. I will follow my process of getting that ethics in myself as writing down in words. I have actually been thinking about how I should have my ethics as a designer during my undergraduate project. That time, I was researching urban food waste in Tokyo, Japan which was mainly produced and wasted in combini stores. While researching, I have reached out to so many stakeholders including some people who can be considered as socially vulnerable such as homeless and welfare recipients. I always considered where this project leads out to, because I and my design can be egoistic to someone that I had encountered during the research. I first had a desire to design something like a product or the system that can be a solution for food waste in city, but I did not want to take over the current ones because it has a possibility to unnecesarily hurt someone. Just because I didn\u2019t want to be egoistic to change something by my design, I took a way not to design everything but showing how people can participate in the design. And it was successful from an ethical perspective. Though, there was always a conflict inside me because I also wanted to design something despite what. I think it is a limitation to the ethics in design. Now at MDEF, I continue to work on the food waste topics with compost as a dynamism of my design proposition. I wanted to make a toolkit that can make everyone engage in compost making. For this, I also had to have this ethical question whether or not to use technology. I think technology like sensors can help people to understand what they are doing, though it can also be a barrier for them to truly understand or embody what they are doing. It is also true that they can use low-tech things to detect what they need to know. So I chose not to make a technological solution for compost making, but as experimental, I used sensors to learn this usage as a designer. It is useful to know but once you understand the theory of what you\u2019re doing, for this time how compost works, you don\u2019t need to use any fancy tools.I think so many things don\u2019t require technology. But at the same time it is also true that everything is such a technology, compared to old indegenous knowledge and skills. I think now is the time to carefully think about why the world and life has adjusted to this kind of place full of technology. It is modernization,capitalism,globalization, and so on. Understanding that, then I can choose the ethical way to deal with things as a designer. Also for my MDEF project for doing compost, I had faced this question of how I should design or what I should design for a community. I was also working with local people who are working for a community garden in Poblenou, and it was really hard to communicate with them. They are doing this community garden as a form of democratic participation. They always have to consent among them by making everyone agree on one single decision. When I as a student ,who wanted to collaborate with them, went there to talk about setting up a new compost bin, they started to talk about where ro place the compost bin and it took more than two weeks for them to decide. At that time, I thought I needed to design a workshop or something to let them think and do the compost together so it would not take that long. Though my project mate said that he wanted to be patient with them so he let them do what they do. And the result was that, taking so much time on just deciding a place. I totally disagree with this design decision that he has made of not designing, I think as a designer we should have chosen the best way to lead them by designing in the right direction. And I think that is an important role for a designer to act as design ethics instead of being patient nor controlling people. Designers should be equal to the people. For the next step of my project, I will design a compost platform that can be open for anyone, and people can use their own creativity to output as their own cases. It is not controlling nor changing someone\u2019s or something\u2019s life. I, as a designer, show what is ethical to the world through what I do, instead of designing artifacts but a network that triggers people. Above that is a professionalism that I can say about a designer. I think that it is hard to act as an ethically professional designer by themself. It is always needed to have some reflection from a third person point of view. I guess that designers should not always forget that our decision can change someone\u2019s or something\u2019s life because the profession we have is super dependent on people. And that changing someone\u2019s life can be both a good or bad experience for both us designers and the people who receive. Though that does not mean that we always should just listen to the people, because I think that professional value as a designer is what kind of assessment that you can show through your design and how it can have an impact on people, species, earth, and so on. Between those realities and designer ethics, integrating both sides of them, we can design something that is a professional design.","title":"01 Design Ethics"},{"location":"Term3/01-Design%20Ethics/#design-ethics-reflection","text":"It was a meaningful series of classes for me to think about my project and how I want to be a professional as a designer.

As a continuous approach from the last term\u2019s community engagement in Poblenou, Emilio and I decided to keep working with them to co-design a compost bin together for their community garden with local people. We first built up the scheme for local people to engage in the process of making compost together. Also at the same time, we decided to work on the platform-networking approach by making a website and some open-source data, in order to build a network. In my theory, for keeping up both approaches would lead it to achieve the goal of making people engage in the compost making activity to make a new urban lifestyle. Before co-designing a compost bin, we tried to make a humidity sensor to send the information to your device through wi-fi in order to make it easier to see the status. When we talk about compost making, we are lacking input to know if we are doing well or not if we are not used to working with soil and plants. With that in mind, it is needed to design something that can give a lecture and create an output of information that could be available for a community and in that way activate the participation. We intend to use this concept to design interaction between sensors that can be connected to the soil or the compost in order to connect to the people in the community and have a social action and integration in the task that benefits all\u2026 Somehow we wanted to pursue the way that we share collected data community-wise since we are engaged in this community garden in Poblenou. Emilio tried hard to control this humidity sensor using an Arduino IDE for the CPU we had of ESP32. So many problems happened through this process because the sensor gives random numbers which indicate the voltage that the sensor senses. So it was hard to convert them into the number percentages. Also, the percentage was somehow backward from the actual number. So it was also hard to fix it how it is supposed to be. In the end, it is connected to the rechargeable battery to be on its own so it doesn\u2019t have to be connected to a computer. With a 3d printed case for both battery and the CPU, it can be embedded in the soil of plants/compost. While printing, Emilio worked on the Html to visualize the percentage in a nicer way to show information. Afterward, the printing has been fixed into a nicer box and we used a rechargeable battery to keep it turned on for a while. We tested it several times and it worked out. Our plan was to put this into the co-design compost at the community garden to make local people understand the status of their compost to decide their actions towards it. This is why we keep the UI super simple to easily get the information on humidity. We hoped to duplicate this system for different sensors or use a low-tech way to check the soil status at the community garden. For the community engagement project, we first started by designing a three-layer compost bin that has the following stages: throwing in the organic waste and decomposing, resting, and ready to use. We first designed and cut out the profile of this bin by using CNC, then brought it up to the community garden. We have been to the community garden several times before we started building a compost bin, so that is how we had some insights on what they want and how we should be working with these people. Then on the first day of the co-design project, two or three people from the community garden came to the site, where they were arguing about where to place the compost. Because they have this political structure of organizing the members as a democracy, everyone has to agree on every decision they make. We had to wait hours until they finally started talking about the place. While that, we started to assemble the compost bin using some waste materials on the street. I think, to be honest, we should have designed the agenda and goals for the co-design workshop because I think that is how a designer should behave toward people for building something together. Doing everything together is impossible and I think that we don\u2019t have to be patient with locals. We should be equal to them. Though Emilio refused to do so and he is the one communicating with them in Spanish, I was not able to say anything. Since Emilio did not help me out translating what they said and what I wanted to tell them, I totally got left out of the group. This way, I thought I couldn\u2019t do anything since I am the one that is not engaged in this co-design process, so I decided not to do the community engagement approach anymore. Actually, my interest was pretty much in community making, but how much I asked Emilio to help me translate and help me communicate, he never did it to me. Despite what I wanted to do, I got down. Instead, I decided to develop the platform approach by trying to build a website and make some open-source parametric data. It is really mortifying and regrettable that it turned out like this which has nothing to do with my will. Anyway, I did what I could do in the end. So, for the platform approach that I have been developing, I first started by making a website mock-up. I was wondering how to make one like precious plastic, so I thought about making it have these core features: network map, introducing communities, and sharing open-source. After I was talking and reviewing by Tomas Civianco, he advised me to just make it really simple and easy. So I decided to make it by using Wix and also share some videos to show the process of co-designing community compost. At the same time, I have been developing to make this open-source data that I want to share on the platform which lets people download and adjust it to their own cases. I first started by making parameters on the compost bin to change the size, thickness of the wall, number of joints, and so on. It was challenging for me because I have never used the grasshopper before, I just started out learning from zero to make one. My best reference is this simple website. Also for having a user interface, I tried to use the grasshopper plugin called human UI to have a window that shows parameters to let you change them as you like. For now, I am still working on it but I hope to finish it for the MDEFest. For the MDEFest, despite what is happening to me, we will hold a celebration event at the community garden to cheer for the complement of co-design compost, with local people drinking and eating food from the garden. There we will show the videos of the process of co-designing and introducing the platform. That is going to be the closure of this project. Alternative Present \u00b6 The alternative present that I have been thinking about out of my project is the possibility of compost making. Compost-making is what makes the future possibilities for agriculture, food, and the energy for living things on earth. If we keep living like this, I am sure that someday we will realize that we are lacking so many resources. I guess it is already happening, but more conspicuously. Everything is limited. Also not only for the resources reasons, but we can also lack food. Now Japan is facing the problem of lacking enough imported food. Also, we are facing the problem of the fertilizers for agriculture rising slightly. This means that even the price of domestic production would slightly rise. While our salary rises and economic growth is not happening, how can citizens even economically survive in this situation? The daily diet can be changed to bad manners because citizens cannot afford to buy food that used to be not so expensive. This economical effect came from the Russian invasion and import agreement. Political effects are also one of the big problems that we cannot do anything with. I think for this kind of situation, I want to promote the compost making to people and local governments by telling them that this would help us in the way of producing. This is why I am developing a platform that can form networks all over the world, making alternative systems of producing food and making circulation from households or communities besides the political problems, and coming resources problems. Also, the community engagement that I was doing is an alternative possibility for the present local life. It was one of the examples of future communities. And I am also working on the compost at the household to represent the alternative presence of urban circulation under compost networks. I hope this platform works out and in the near future that I can develop how we can produce to live better by introducing these possibilities. Final Reflection \u00b6 However, many things were more difficult for me personally than learning. I felt the exclusivity characteristic of the Spanish-speaking world everywhere, especially in the community garden. And as a person from oriental culture, I often felt uncomfortable in many situations. Through these experiences, I was unable to develop a sense of independence toward Barcelona, and I could no longer find meaning in committing myself to this land. Originally, I had been thinking to stay here a little longer before returning to Japan immediately after graduation. Because I had planned to continue working on the project if it turned out to be successful, but this did not happen. Although I was enjoying a livable city with a good living situation, I decided to return to Japan because I decided that it would not be beneficial to me in terms of my project. (I want to emphasize that I am not fed up with living abroad and would like to live in another country if the opportunity arises.) Through the master\u2019s in Barcelona, I have gained a remarkable understanding of the importance. When I am in Japan, I want to place myself in the community and take ownership of the land, and I would like to find a place where this can be realized. Also, I can honestly say that my project at IaaC was not a successful one by any stretch of the imagination. It would be difficult to say that you can build something from scratch in 9 months while also completing classes. Of course, some things can be done on the spur of the moment, but it was difficult to build a project that answers the \u201cweak signal\u201d and is truly radical and financially sound. I have nothing but criticisms to offer about the program, but for better or worse, I am certain that one of the things I learned was to develop objectivity. However, for my own sake, I would like to rethink what I have learned this past year. Personally, I can say that what I have learned from this year is that I was able to input methodologies to find the \u201cweak signals\u201d around me and scale out the signals and consider their potential for development at various levels, and from there connect them to my own design. I got the impression that this part of the MDEF framework is the most important perspective to cultivate when working as a designer, so I think I was able to understand that part of the framework. On the other hand, I could not deny that the scale required to connect to my own design was still very system change-oriented. Gig solutions to weak signals were unbalanced, and the lack of theories in between these things was noticeable. The expectation of more possibilities beyond that should be built into the framework. However, it is an interesting fact that IaaC is taking the lead in network-making design projects such as Fabcity and distributed design, and I was personally influenced by this. I think it was part of my learning experience to be in such an environment beyond the framework of a program.","title":"Final Project"},{"location":"Term3/Final%20Project/#final-project","text":"","title":"Final Project"},{"location":"Term3/Final%20Project/#fial-project","text":"For the final intervention, there are so many things going on with my project and how I expected it to be. As a continuous approach from the last term\u2019s community engagement in Poblenou, Emilio and I decided to keep working with them to co-design a compost bin together for their community garden with local people. We first built up the scheme for local people to engage in the process of making compost together. Also at the same time, we decided to work on the platform-networking approach by making a website and some open-source data, in order to build a network. In my theory, for keeping up both approaches would lead it to achieve the goal of making people engage in the compost making activity to make a new urban lifestyle. Before co-designing a compost bin, we tried to make a humidity sensor to send the information to your device through wi-fi in order to make it easier to see the status. When we talk about compost making, we are lacking input to know if we are doing well or not if we are not used to working with soil and plants. With that in mind, it is needed to design something that can give a lecture and create an output of information that could be available for a community and in that way activate the participation. We intend to use this concept to design interaction between sensors that can be connected to the soil or the compost in order to connect to the people in the community and have a social action and integration in the task that benefits all\u2026 Somehow we wanted to pursue the way that we share collected data community-wise since we are engaged in this community garden in Poblenou. Emilio tried hard to control this humidity sensor using an Arduino IDE for the CPU we had of ESP32. So many problems happened through this process because the sensor gives random numbers which indicate the voltage that the sensor senses. So it was hard to convert them into the number percentages. Also, the percentage was somehow backward from the actual number. So it was also hard to fix it how it is supposed to be. In the end, it is connected to the rechargeable battery to be on its own so it doesn\u2019t have to be connected to a computer. With a 3d printed case for both battery and the CPU, it can be embedded in the soil of plants/compost. While printing, Emilio worked on the Html to visualize the percentage in a nicer way to show information. Afterward, the printing has been fixed into a nicer box and we used a rechargeable battery to keep it turned on for a while. We tested it several times and it worked out. Our plan was to put this into the co-design compost at the community garden to make local people understand the status of their compost to decide their actions towards it. This is why we keep the UI super simple to easily get the information on humidity. We hoped to duplicate this system for different sensors or use a low-tech way to check the soil status at the community garden. For the community engagement project, we first started by designing a three-layer compost bin that has the following stages: throwing in the organic waste and decomposing, resting, and ready to use. We first designed and cut out the profile of this bin by using CNC, then brought it up to the community garden. We have been to the community garden several times before we started building a compost bin, so that is how we had some insights on what they want and how we should be working with these people. Then on the first day of the co-design project, two or three people from the community garden came to the site, where they were arguing about where to place the compost. Because they have this political structure of organizing the members as a democracy, everyone has to agree on every decision they make. We had to wait hours until they finally started talking about the place. While that, we started to assemble the compost bin using some waste materials on the street. I think, to be honest, we should have designed the agenda and goals for the co-design workshop because I think that is how a designer should behave toward people for building something together. Doing everything together is impossible and I think that we don\u2019t have to be patient with locals. We should be equal to them. Though Emilio refused to do so and he is the one communicating with them in Spanish, I was not able to say anything. Since Emilio did not help me out translating what they said and what I wanted to tell them, I totally got left out of the group. This way, I thought I couldn\u2019t do anything since I am the one that is not engaged in this co-design process, so I decided not to do the community engagement approach anymore. Actually, my interest was pretty much in community making, but how much I asked Emilio to help me translate and help me communicate, he never did it to me. Despite what I wanted to do, I got down. Instead, I decided to develop the platform approach by trying to build a website and make some open-source parametric data. It is really mortifying and regrettable that it turned out like this which has nothing to do with my will. Anyway, I did what I could do in the end.

At the time, I also started doing my worm compost in order to compare with aerobic compost that I have been doing. Then I am trying to make a biomaterial shovel as a compost toolkit. I first drew a diagram for the household compost project which I want to archive. Starting from your food waste at home, it is made into compost that can produce so many things. To do this, I need to first try to make a sensor. When I talked with Jonathan and Tomas, they taught us so many references and people that have knowledge and skills for making compost sensors. I contacted them and will be in touch soon. I compared worm compost and aerobic compost by doing both. I did it to design a toolkit that can be used in any kind of compost. I summarized it to see how it differs in the process. It has been only 10days, I can get to know a lot of things. (Recently I have started doing worm compost and Emilio started doing aerobic compost at home!) Rei\u2019s worm compost Emilio\u2019s aerobic compost As a result, it is case by case and depends on what you want for the compost, though It seems that aerobic compost is the easiest and practical for anyone. This comparison shows the sensor should have at least the scale of ph, humidity, temperature, smell features. I think I can also ask the grow observatory what features should be scaled for healthy soil. Also, I am trying to develop a toolkit by using biomaterials that have additives of food waste. Now I make a mold and will try to make a shovel with coffee waste and eggshells. I want to use food waste that can take time to compost for making biomaterial as a part of a toolkit. Last design intervention was a small first step for us that we actually did not design something physical. We had this two workshops to make people more conscious and interested in the compost making as their companion species. We had this idea as a way, in the future, people will need to grow their own food and energy so the compost can be the key source for this coming situation. Also, the important thing is that people should be responsible and explicit about how food is produced and wasted in the current system, which is a black box. We want to open up the black box and let people do something in the system as we are all living together on the earth, co-working with companion species. This intervention, we need to start designing things on hands as we will continue our subject for doing compost. We believe that this circular system has to replace the linear system in which food is distributed nowadays, this linear system takes the user off the source of the food and place it only as a consumer not as a producer, placing them in a passive roll; this roll doesn\u2019t allow to the user to participate in the system actively with the only function of consume and generate waste. No one can be responsible for their food and also waste. Therefore, the user doesn\u2019t realize the amount of resources needed for the production and the resources disposed as waste. In a circular system the waste is perceived as a resource, meaning that people waste could be used to create new soil, land in form of the compost then, to grow their own food, in this system could interact some producers and intermediaries. It can be a design for Anthropocene that we can bring some impacts on the relationship between land and our human bodies.

As I was curious about the massive industrial food waste in Japan, I started working at the combini store which is an infrastructure for people in the city, to see the reality. In the system, food waste is reprocessed for livestock feed and they come back to a store as new food. Combini company says it\u2019s a sustainable system but it actually keeps wasting food. Working as a staff\u2000at the combini, I tried to distribute the food waste by reaching out to homeless people and food bank. Though, it failed because dead food had no demand for them. I needed to change the direction of how to reuse the food waste. At the time, I was invited to the little island where people are self-efficient about their food. There I learned about community compost and it can also grow food for them. This compost makes a circulation as well as the connection between the land and their bodies. I started doing compost at home also trying to make this connection and circulation in the city. I proposed the idea to the combini store and had the compost workshop together with the owner and the company manager. Compost can be a medium for the community as well as it can solve the huge food waste problem in the store and produce vegetables in the store. I wanted to make a platform and a system to make it happen. For that I started doing this intervention to make more people engaged in compost making. This is why Emilio and I started our intervention as a companion compost workshop to teach people how making compost has possibilities to survive future urban life. Our goal is to have future citizens presented in the diagram below. Main thing is to grow food and produce energy by making compost. To achieve this goal, we decided to take small steps and the first step was this companion compost making workshops. We did two workshops for this intervention. Emilio\u2019s 5-year-old nephew in the states. Online and made compost together by showing presentation slides and telling them how to do it. MDEF friends in the IaaC class room. Explained why we are doing this intervention and made a compost together. The objective pursued was to design the experience of compost making so that it becomes a habit or personal activity and to be perceived as a companion species for them, besides an opportunity of exploring the personal organic waste. Learning waste is not waste, but it can be the production resource and also doing compost is making your pet-companion species that are living together in your world line. After finishing the workshops, we detect several opportunities to improve the experience, therefore we formulate a design question for continuing the design process. \u00b7 For a better impact it is necessary to have a co-design process in order to design a toolkit that allows any person to engage in the compost making. \u00b7 The personal compost making activity could lead us to a community engagement activity in the form of a sharing resources platform. \u00b7 Our intent after that, would be directed to design an experience that could generate a change in the personality to have more people interested in making positive changes and make compost making a regenerative activity for the future such as toolkit/platform. Next attempt we are going to do is designing a toolkit or interface that attracts people to do it everyday with joy and fun. At the design dialogues exhibition, we have got a lot of feedback on how to make it a daily activity for people at any age and any type of the house. We should make it easy, fun, interactive, smell-less, and space-less. To overcome these important objects, I am going to start off interviewing people who have actually done making compost toolkits. Then we are going to design and do some workshops or probes in order to see how actual compost makers feel about it. At the same time, we are going to open a platform where people can share ideas and fears as well as resources.

Then I made a pine resin based biomaterial with eggshells and a pinch of orange peel to make its color orange. I actually wanted to put a wooden handle, so I put it in the mold but it didn\u2019t stay. I used it for mixing compost and it works, but then I got so many reflections. -It should be hard because it sometimes bent like a gum -It should have had a handle to mix -it should be a bit bigger in size so that it can mix more at a time -it should be a shovel? I will probably refer to the indegenous tools for tool making. Also I have some reflections on the method of making. -the mold should not be complicated shape when using plywood mold -it should not require digital fabrication for making mold -the method and the recipe also should be open source so it should be done with the ingredients that are easily found at supermarket So now I will try to make another shape and way to make a mold with a new recipe I will think of. Maybe using wasted rice can be like glue to make the material harder. I will try. Second, in the fabacademy I made a transparent compost box that shows what is thrown inside and temperature change. In the beginning, I wanted to use sensors for detecting the status of compost, but when talking with Guillem he told me that technology is not always the answer. (Also I am not good at electronics) Then I chose to use a thermochromic paint that changes the color between 26-31 degrees so I can assume how much compost is being active by seeing the color change. I used the laser cutter to make it and it is two layers. Also the material is acrylic, it shows inside and food waste that can lead to waste consciousness for people. Top layer is for composting and the bottom layer is for the soil that is ready to use. The bottom part in the top layer has many holes, so some ready to use compost will be sieved to go down. It can be a pot for planting when there is enough soil inside. I just started to place it in the MDEF class room for classmates to use it and test it, it will be our intervention from now on to see how people would use it. Also then I can make supre if the color change really works and could it be effective for the process. Lastly, I have been in contact with alumni Pablo who had Farmacademyas his project. He is helping me to improve my project and introduced Abonokm0, Miki. I will have a meeting with him next week to see how I can collaborate with him. Also I talked with Oscar Gonzales that he was a part of Grow Observatory. He taught me how this kind of project works and what I should do now. He told me that now I should focus on one feature of the compost -like temperature - if I am making a toolkit to detect the data/status. So that I now concentrate on how to get the temperature change of the compost and how I can make it interactive and fun for people who do the compost.","title":"Design Intervention 2"},{"location":"project/Design%20Intervention%202/#design-intervention-2","text":"For the 2nd intervention, it was not for me to intervene with people, but with materials as I used the fabacademy and remixing materials for the opportunity to prototype.

We interviewed people below. 1)Madrid Community Compost (https://compostajecomunitariohtz.wordpress.com/) They are the group of people who approach the government and engage into the education of teaching how to compost at local elementary schools in Madrid. We basically asked how they manage to be involved at the community level. Also they put a blog about the meeting with us. 2)Emilio\u2019s Design office partner Rebecca She is also a professor at the university where she teaches design. Recently she got this project from the faculty that she and her students researched about how much their university produces waste every day and every year. She then thought about the compost can be a good solution for this and will start some kind of prototypes with her students. She shared that the school in the community can be the hub for waste management in the city. 3)Abonokm0 Miki He is also a guy who charges in connecthort. Pablo introduced him to us. We basically shared what we are doing and came up with a way to think if we could collaborate in some way. Food waste Biomaterial carry bag Since we thought it is also a way to make compost as activities for people to be involved, we started to think of another way of doing compost other than having it at home. Also our classmates asked if they could bring their food waste to the community garden. We decided to develop a carry bag that they can put their food waste inside and throw away the whole thing. So the material should be compostable and obviously we used some organic waste to make it. This time I wanted to try bio leather and this recipe, we used wasted tea leaves for this. I followed this recipe. http://fabtextiles.org/coffee-leather-bag/ Recipe: 12G sodium alginate 12G dried tea leaves 12G oil 30G glycerin 198G water MIX for calcification 7G of calcium chloride in 100ml of water How: 1- Weight all the ingredients with a precision scale. 2- Mix the tea leaves and sodium alginate together with the glycerin and the oil. 3- Add the water and use a mechanical blender to obtain an homogeneous solution. 4- Mix the Calcium chloride with water in a sprayer bottle. 5- Spray the biomaterial on top and bottom with the calcium chloride solution. 6- Cast in a frame. Spread the solution with a spatula to make the surface smooth. 7- Let the calcium chloride act for 5 8- Let the composite sample dry in a dry and warm place. 9- When the product is dry you can separate it from the frame. It is still drying so I have not been trying to sew it yet, but I will try as soon as it dries. I also want to try this one to use a laser for biomaterial and make a bag without sewing. 3.Organic Material Library This is what Julia,Pippa, and Fiorella were developing for the Fabacademy challenge to make an organic matter material list relating to the shelf they made. I asked them if I could join for adding information about compost. I am still researching it but hopefully we can publish it by the end of this term. Rooftop Compost and gardening This is also what we are doing as a group with classmates to make the IaaC rooftop as a continuous experimentation place for especially those who has interest in bio and solar punks. Emilio and I will make a community compost for all IaaC and gardening pots to grow some vegetables using compost. For this, Emilio went to hunt some discarded materials on the street and started seeding some vegetables. As soon as we decide to start, we will work on it. 5.Classroom compost observation Continuing from fabacademy challenge, we have been observing how classmates will use our compost. It seems like they have been putting a lot of compostable cups and trays which they bought at nearby cafes. Also some vegetables and fruit skins. Though it seems like they are not mixing it well, so we out up a poster which explains how to use and what to put, I don\u2019t know if it is working, but it will surely take some time to decompose since it is not increasing the temperature which is indicated by the thermochromic paint. Also by puting real temperature sensor and humidity sensor, it is obvious that it is not warm. I need to think how it can do well. 6.Community engagement in Poblenou As we talked with Tomas Vivianco, we started to think about how we could engage in the community. Like our goal is not to make compost but generate something through compost. We started to interview at the IaaC neighborhood restaurant in Poblenou. We so far asked NOMAD and Galega for how they are dealing with their organic waste.They told us they are just throwing them away into the Barcelona city organic waste bin on the street. They said they don\u2019t separate precisely on what they are throwing away like they mix vegetable peels and leftovers together. If we could have a good relationship to make their industrial waste throw into the compost we make( or not), it would be a circulation in the community which is what we want to archive. Also we started to get in touch with the Maripossas community. It looks like they had a compost before so if we can get in touch about it.","title":"Design Intervention 3"},{"location":"project/Design%20Intervention%203/#design-intervention-3","text":"From the last design intervention, we have been developing several things below though all of them are ongoing. 1.Interviews with compost makers 2.Food waste Biomaterial carry bag 3.Organic Material Library 4.Rooftop Compost and gardening 5.Classroom compost observation 6.Community engagement in Poblenou Interviews with compost makers As we wanted to develop and exchange the knowledge and skills relating to our project, we have been interviewing and communicating with many people.

I have been doing a project with that in mind for past years. Though, my actual interest is not thinking about sustainability nor climate change. What I really want to work on is how to make people be aware and take responsibility of living. I thought about this since I realized everything around us, I mean infrastructure and systems are in black box. We do not know what is behind the scenes. That way people will never stop wasting less. People will never stop engaging in the bad part of capitalism. Even if a system changes in a good way, the same bad things will happen again as long as people in a system realize to change how they should be. So basically this is my position. I have references that are mostly how a designer(or artist) himself/herself goes to see the reality of cases and they find out how to break through it. I want to see the reality of the cases which I want to work on and take actions as understanding the real needs. This reality includes problems, systems, structures and etc. of certain case. Ever since I am more comfortable prototyping with myself engaged, I decided to make my compost first. Hoping this can lead to some other kind of ideas beside making a compost kit. My most preferable prototype method will be \u201cmeans of inquiry\u201d. My research type is always kind of ethnography and I like to do the probes and sometimes interview. In my work space, I chose weak signals that are related to circular economy, sustainability, and inter-species which are the big topics of Anthropocene. My First Prototype \u00b6 Since I was interested in bio related design, I decided to make the bioplastic. I first did the agar-agar one, then tried eggshell one. These are materials I used. Recipe; https://materiom.org/recipe/41 As I followed this recipe to heat the things in a pan and poured the solution into a container. I let them dry for 2 days and it still looks like this. It is not fully dried and still is jelly.I don\u2019t know if I did it differently or if I sit it more it is gonna look like bioplastic. Lt\u2019s see. Recipe;https://materiom.org/recipe/623 As I did using this recipe, I ignored vaccinium myrtillus L (Wild Bilberry powder) which I was not able to buy. I first boiled and dried eggshells then mushed it in little pieces. Rest of the process is similar to the agar-agar one. I mixed solution and eggshell pieces at the end and poured in into a container. Next day when I checked it, it was kind of dried. Still, it seems not smooth because I didn\u2019t mush eggshells enough so it looks bumpy and rough. Maybe I need to buy a grinder. Next, I want to try throwing them away into a compost and see how my bioplastic is going to be biodegraded.","title":"Design Space"},{"location":"project/Design%20Space/#my-first-prototype","text":"Since I was interested in bio related design, I decided to make the bioplastic.
