What did you learn? How can your learning process be described? Please use bullet points. How is this relevant to your work and personal development? Oct.4-8 This week was a first week after 2021 academic year has officially started at IaaC and our course MDEF. As everyone gathered for the first time in our classroom, we started to exchange our beliefs that also explains our fight. My Fight My fight is a bit too specific. I explained as I want to design the soil of urban areas using food waste to make compost out of it. Because I have doubts on urban infrastructure that is in a black box, like we will never know what is actually happening behind our scenes of life. This black box situation is leading to people unconscious about making a huge amount of waste in industry or even at home. I am now willing to change that situation and make food waste into some kind of nutrition of cities which can become some food production-urban farming in a future. For that, my keywords will be circular design, soil design, food waste, compost, and urban farming. \u30fb I was able to get to know what everyone is fighting for. \u30fb I was able to look back what I want to do and why I came to IaaC. \u30fb I was able to imagine that I can collaborate with someone when working on a real project in a future. Elisava Elisava tour was interesting as it is so much different from IaaC education and facility. They have basically every kind of machines- laser cutter, CNC router with 3 axis, 3D printers, coping machines, bio-related machines, and so on\u2026 Elisava is somehow so much like \u201cacademia\u201d for me, though I think it is good for me to go both IaaC and Elisava, learning in between them. I was also impressed to see graduation project that each student at Elisava has developed. \u30fb I was able to see the difference between IaaC and Elisava. \u30fb I realized I can use the difference of these two in a good way when learning and making. \u30fb Thesis examples from past year\u2019s students that Oscar showed us really pushed me to work hard. Skills/Knowledge/Altitude Personal vision is something I have never tried to think of before because I had a tiny tiny goal for everything I did that won\u2019t improve me at all. When I thought of it and actually had a meeting with other people to exchange our visions, it somehow improved me to have a real goal I want to achieve every week of our session. \u30fb I was able to think deeply about my vision both as designer and a person. \u30fb Long term vision is hard to make it true but will encourage me. \u30fb It is always important to think about vision because it gives you some hints on your work as well. Gitlab Website Making website using gitlab is pretty hard. Also keeping website active is hard as well. I already have my website that I run with my friends and it is hard to keep it updated, so this is. Git is so confusing but I tried. \u30fb It is always good to update/archive what you\u2019ve up to because this will give you a opportunity to connect with others. \u30fb it is important to reflect what you\u2019ve learnt and archive it in order to improve yourself. Poblenou Poblenou is such an inspiring place. I can find anything nice here. It is said Poblenou 10 years ago was nothing, though these 10 years artists and designers started to move here and became such a lovely neighborhood. I tried to find a flat in Poblenou, though it was kind of expensive and very popular. I hope this place is not going to be like Brooklyn where gentrification has happened after artists started to live.( well I don\u2019t think so) \u30fb Neighbors are good to make community with and collaborate with. \u30fb Making furnitures out of trash happens. \u30fb Mobility is well concerned and its sharing mind is impressing. \u30fb urban farming makes sharing economy, also culture and community. I used to do urban design with research and also a bit of architecture. Somehow there is many people thinking about how to make this place better and really work on it. This means there is many ways I can connect my interest to. I am really looking forward to collaborate with people or projects I have met this week.

Weak signals are analysis of the main change factors that shows certain directions of now day society. Through out the week, we have been introduced to those weak signals and thought about how to connect them to our interests. First, we did this exercise to randomly select a weak signal and make a scenario on how to make a change with it. Afterward, we had to choose one weak signal that we want to think about. Q. Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago? I chose Inter-species Collaboration. It has been my interest for last several years how human beings can live with soil and microorganisms in the soil or air. I had been interested in compost since I did my graduation project on turning food waste into compost at urban infrastructure system combini. (Just as I talked about it as my fight) Since then, I also got interested in soil and microorganisms. As I was impressed by Donna Haraway who says her compost is also her partner in a sense of \u201csignificant others\u201d, I wanted to make that kind of relationship more practical in a city. I actually chose Fight Anthropocene Conflicts as my second weak signal which it is related to the topic of food waste I was also interested about. Also chose Circular Data Economy as my third one as I was interested about how to make everyone involved in a process of making compost using fabrication. Q. Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. As I was too sick to go for a hiking, I did my looking at weak signals in a situated approach through scales exercise in my room. As my weak signal \u201cInter species collaboration\u201d , I could just think something very general. Mostly related to my shopping experience at grocery store, when I choose vegetables and if it is genetically modified or not. Farther more, I recognized this city Barcelona is mostly covered with concrete blocks which means it is hard to see soils, relating this to my interest in soil. It was hard for me to think about a weak signal in national or global situation because my question towards society is always related to my experience in life. Though going through this exercise brought me learn that I need to relate things in larger scale which can be led to a change factor in society. Q. How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? It was such a hard exercise for me. Everyone has chosen close topics, though everyone\u2019s approach and way of thinking is different. For example, someone in my group was interested in making sustainable product because she cares about climate change, though my view towards sustainability is a bit different from hers so we kind of ended up making a board on their own purposes. Our team set our theme as \u201cWhat happens after Product\u2019t life cycle?\u201d, it is okay for me but what I want to think more about is how people can be responsible for product\u2019s life cycle. If we could have more time, we could just talk and explain what we really think about on each topics. Though, I learned there is many ways to approach one single problem in a society because everyone has a different approach. This means I can learn from others so I could have exchanged more about our thoughts just like it was nice that we could exchange some projects that relate. 1. Someone you would like to contact 1. RemixThe School 2. SISCODE 3. ROMI 4. FOOD SHIFT 2. An experiment you\u2019d like to make 1. I want to try designing a toolkit for helping people make compost in their house in a city. Also I want to make a soil as a new material which everyone can get for free. 3. A new skill you\u2019d like to add to your personal development plan 1.
