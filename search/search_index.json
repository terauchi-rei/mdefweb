I have been doing a project with that in mind for past years. Though, my actual interest is not thinking about sustainability nor climate change. What I really want to work on is how to make people be aware and take responsibility of living. I thought about this since I realized everything around us, I mean infrastructure and systems are in black box. We do not know what is behind the scenes. That way people will never stop wasting less. People will never stop engaging in the bad part of capitalism. Even if a system changes in a good way, the same bad things will happen again as long as people in a system realize to change how they should be. So basically this is my position. I have references that are mostly how a designer(or artist) himself/herself goes to see the reality of cases and they find out how to break through it. I want to see the reality of the cases which I want to work on and take actions as understanding the real needs. This reality includes problems, systems, structures and etc. of certain case. Ever since I am more comfortable prototyping with myself engaged, I decided to make my compost first. Hoping this can lead to some other kind of ideas beside making a compost kit. My most preferable prototype method will be \u201cmeans of inquiry\u201d. My research type is always kind of ethnography and I like to do the probes and sometimes interview. In my work space, I chose weak signals that are related to circular economy, sustainability, and inter-species which are the big topics of Anthropocene.

As everyone gathered for the first time in our classroom, we started to exchange our beliefs that also explains our fight. My Fight \u00b6 My fight is a bit too specific. I explained as I want to design the soil of urban areas using food waste to make compost out of it. Because I have doubts on urban infrastructure that is in a black box, like we will never know what is actually happening behind our scenes of life. This black box situation is leading to people unconscious about making a huge amount of waste in industry or even at home. I am now willing to change that situation and make food waste into some kind of nutrition of cities which can become some food production-urban farming in a future. For that, my keywords will be circular design, soil design, food waste, compost, and urban farming. \u30fb I was able to get to know what everyone is fighting for. \u30fb I was able to look back what I want to do and why I came to IaaC. \u30fb I was able to imagine that I can collaborate with someone when working on a real project in a future.

Weak signals are analysis of the main change factors that shows certain directions of now day society. Through out the week, we have been introduced to those weak signals and thought about how to connect them to our interests. First, we did this exercise to randomly select a weak signal and make a scenario on how to make a change with it. Afterward, we had to choose one weak signal that we want to think about. Q. Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago? I chose Inter-species Collaboration. It has been my interest for last several years how human beings can live with soil and microorganisms in the soil or air. I had been interested in compost since I did my graduation project on turning food waste into compost at urban infrastructure system combini. (Just as I talked about it as my fight) Since then, I also got interested in soil and microorganisms. As I was impressed by Donna Haraway who says her compost is also her partner in a sense of \u201csignificant others\u201d, I wanted to make that kind of relationship more practical in a city. I actually chose Fight Anthropocene Conflicts as my second weak signal which it is related to the topic of food waste I was also interested about. Also chose Circular Data Economy as my third one as I was interested about how to make everyone involved in a process of making compost using fabrication. Q. Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. As I was too sick to go for a hiking, I did my looking at weak signals in a situated approach through scales exercise in my room. As my weak signal \u201cInter species collaboration\u201d , I could just think something very general. Mostly related to my shopping experience at grocery store, when I choose vegetables and if it is genetically modified or not. Farther more, I recognized this city Barcelona is mostly covered with concrete blocks which means it is hard to see soils, relating this to my interest in soil. It was hard for me to think about a weak signal in national or global situation because my question towards society is always related to my experience in life. Though going through this exercise brought me learn that I need to relate things in larger scale which can be led to a change factor in society. Q. How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? It was such a hard exercise for me. Everyone has chosen close topics, though everyone\u2019s approach and way of thinking is different. For example, someone in my group was interested in making sustainable product because she cares about climate change, though my view towards sustainability is a bit different from hers so we kind of ended up making a board on their own purposes. Our team set our theme as \u201cWhat happens after Product\u2019t life cycle?\u201d, it is okay for me but what I want to think more about is how people can be responsible for product\u2019s life cycle. If we could have more time, we could just talk and explain what we really think about on each topics. Though, I learned there is many ways to approach one single problem in a society because everyone has a different approach. This means I can learn from others so I could have exchanged more about our thoughts just like it was nice that we could exchange some projects that relate. 1. Someone you would like to contact 1. RemixThe School 2. SISCODE 3. ROMI 4. FOOD SHIFT 2. An experiment you\u2019d like to make 1. I want to try designing a toolkit for helping people make compost in their house in a city. Also I want to make a soil as a new material which everyone can get for free. 3. A new skill you\u2019d like to add to your personal development plan 1.

What we learned in the class was basically the basics of biology and agriculture. We had a lot of hands-on experiments and learning of basic contents. First week we learned about what biology is and the first thing we started off with was growing baterias in a container, which is bacteria we got from around IaaC. I rubbed a tree surface and my iPhone and rubbed medium in a container. As time passes, I have noticed , in this world there are microorganisms/bacterias everywhere. This is why we really need to wash or sanitize our hands now. The other day we learned about spirulina and tried to grow it. Though it is hard to grow it( and it is why spirulina was only growing in specific places in the world). It will be a savior to the world of hunger if many people are really able to grow it everywhere.Though I did not find any difference than taking a capsule of proteins or minerals. We also tried growing our own kombucha in a small pot and learned how fermentation processes. Now a pot is at my home and scoby seems to be growing little by little. Also we learned how to use microscopes and how it works. As we learned how to use microscopes, our perspective also got micro. I feel like I can think about things on a micro scale now so that is how I am now interested in the world of microorganisms in soil. Second week was much about agriculture(+biology combined). What I enjoyed the most is about soil, how it is specified in types and circular systems flows. I was not able to see soil using a microscope, though when I saw it with a digital microscope, even only one scoop of soil had many things in it. I felt it was some kind of galaxy. The lecture ended with bioplastic cooking. My group followed the direction and recipe which was shown by teachers though it did not get thick, it was a failure. Then I noticed even making bioplastic is chemistry and biology. Maybe the formula of each compound was not correct. With that in mind, this bio&agri zero lectures really meant a lot to me. When I make a bioplastic, it really seems to be doing design but it is not. It is chemistry/biology so I need to learn more about it. \u30fb I understood that biology on a different scale could be a different study. \u30fb Microorganisms/bacterias are everywhere so it is good to know that they can be helpful when I design something related to biology. \u30fb In biology, I felt everything natural is based on circulation. \u30fb Agriculture is a tool of survival that human beings have invented to live but even agriculture is in survival now. What do we do? \u30fb Bioplastics are a hot trend now but they also require energy. \u30fb Fermentation is used in daily products especially in food production. Can its process be used for hard things like furniture, architectural material, cloth or etc","title":"03 Bio&Agri Zero"},{"location":"seminars/04-Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/","text":"Living with Your Own Ideas Nov.2-5 \u00b6 This is the machine I made.

It is a personal computer , used for personal work like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing. This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies. This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet. It had an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and 3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port This device could be used for personal use or work. ::: Steps taken \u00b6 First of all we checked if the computer worked. It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. We could check that the iMac worked but we couldn\u2019t check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility. We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system. From this step it was all based on the electronic system behind the computer. We disassembled the motherboard and other components such as hard drive, heat sink, CD lector\u2026 Details of some components: Datasheet for the logicboard (motherboard) http://www.barebonekit.net/apple-imac-a1195-820-1960-a-logic-board_i_mballpe8201960a.aspx Results \u00b6 Q.How many motors we find inside, does it contain a computer or microcontroller? 3 motors. It contains a microcontroller. Q.Did the appliance fail, why? It was properly working when we turned it on. Q.Did the appliance failed?Why? This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone. Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use. Conclusions \u00b6 It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in. Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it\u2019s open. There are more than 100 screws used inside. Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both manufactured by stamping, the stand might be molded. Plastic parts(box) are coated polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore. Opinions \u00b6 At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits, so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder The body it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward. There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws. We can also find a few metals for heat displacement like aluminum and copper. There are also tiny plastic parts that make the connection to the back part of the computer and the boards or the optical unit to the lateral of the computer.

We had two topics, so we generated many different ideas to work with each one, so maybe choosing a general one that could have those two ideas covered, was more convenient. From hypothesis to data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We decided to choose the PiCamera as a tool for the experiment. We thought it would be quite a practical way of checking the availability of IAAC spaces and counting people. However, a physical intervention would have been also an appropriate means to collect data for our case. Tool \ud83d\udd27 usage documentation: \u00b6 We used the PiCamera to create timelapses in two different ways: - POV timelapse: the camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC. - Static timelapse: the camera was static in a specific place and captured everything that happened there. For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px) in order not to have heavy files. We also set the photo frequency to 1 picture per second to have enough information from people\u2019s movements. Data capturing strategy: \u00b6 Our strategy consisted of two main points: The first one was based on checking the different spaces of IAAC with the camera during lunchtime and seeing if there was people eating inside. Thanks to this, we could get information for both of our hypothesis. The second one focused on testing the interest of people around a poster in the entrance communicating a supposed \u201cLunch Room\u201d at IAAC\u2019s main hall. This would let us know about support for this idea. Also, we had to change the strategy in the middle of the data collection since the PiCamera stopped working. Our intention there was to count the amount of people going to eat outside during lunchtime compared to the total of people at IAAC. However, we believe this wasn\u2019t a major problem for our research. Materials needed: \u00b6 Picamera, \u201cLunchRoom\u201d poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms. Detail setup instructions: \u00b6 Data collected \u00b6 Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc. For privacy reasons we are not able to show the images captured by the Raspberry Pi. Two impressions of the data generated shown below. \u201cWhere people are eating lunch inside IAAC building \u201c: \u201cPeople that was interested in the Lunch room poster\u201d: Video recorded with the PiCamera Tips \u00b6 It was hard to analyze what is happening in the captured timelapse data because the camera took pictures every 3 seconds only, so there were things that the camera was not able to capture. Also, we chosed to make the resolution of the data low and it gave us a hard time to analyze things in the timelapse especially for the static one. We would change how the data is captured and output rather than changing how we collect the data.

In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Proving it\u2019s true it will require testing all possible combinations, that\u2019s hard, maybe impossible. ::: Post at least two images of a chart, a screen-shoot of your data, that you used to prove if your hypothesis is false. Tips \u00b6 We think that in order to recollect more data, we have to do it for more days at the same hour (lunch time) because is not precise just knowing how much people had lunch inside Iaac when we know that the quantity may vary depending on the days. And if we want to know the amount of people that enters Iaac and compared it to the people that eats inside for whatever reason, we need to do it for more days. I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lucnh time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"05 Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth-first-week-nov8-12","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond thE Myth first week Nov.8-12"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#forensic-report-imac-2006","text":"Identity of the reporting agency MDEF Case identifier MDEF//21-22_Tech_beyond_the_myth Identity of the submitter iMac Destructor Date of receipt 09/11/2021 Date of report 09/11/2021 Identity and signature of the examiner Emilio,Fioella,Andrea,Rei","title":"Forensic Report: iMac 2006"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#examination","text":"serial number: CK6s0083WH4 Brand: Apple (in California) Model: A1195 apple computer Color: White Assembled in: China Specifications: 1.83/2x512/160 combo/Esp 2006 Tested: Working :::","title":"Examination"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#forensic-questions","text":"How does it work?

So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility. We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system. From this step it was all based on the electronic system behind the computer.

This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone.
