In the beginning of MDEF, I was not really able to get what it is and how it works. Maybe now I can finally make sure and try to do it. Here are 3 examples from last year\u2019s MDEF that I like how they document the fabacademy course. 1. Jose Antonio Uribe I like it because this documentation is based on the linear timeline and I can follow how this person got developed through the course. Roger Guilemany Casas I like it because this person basically documents everything. Even there is no challenge, he just writes reflections and that I can see how this person felt and improved through the course. 3. Alejandra Tothill Calvo I like it because this person really does amazing work for the design. The way of documenting is also interesting that this person embeds some sound files. I will start working on html by following the steps that lecturers showed us. Within term 2, I will try my best to archive my webpage by making my own one. For that I am sure to take these examples to develop my idea.","title":"01 1st Week"},{"location":"Fabacademy/01-1st%20Week/#1st-week-jan26","text":"1st week Jan.26 It was the beginning of Fabacademy, which I was waiting for!

I am used to design with rhinoceros for 3d modeling but other software is not practical for me. This time, because we had a blender session, I tried to use it as much as I could. I learned the basics so I am not that skillful to design anything with the blender yet, so I tried first to model the coffee cup which could be the easiest for me now. I rendered by trying to put the materials on each part and lights for the rendering. I watched some tutorial videos on Youtube that gently taught me the basic skills. After learning through the coffee cup modeling, I then tried to model something that relates to my project. I modeled the Compotbot which can be a speculation for my project because I am trying to design a compost toolkit sensor now that detects some important information to keep compost healthy. If I had more time and more skills, I want to try modeling sensors that can really work. I am sure I will try it when I am designing a sensor.","title":"02 2nd Week Computer Aided Design"},{"location":"Fabacademy/02-2nd%20Week%20Computer%20Aided%20Design/#2nd-week-feb7-computer-aided-design","text":"This week we learned computer aided design.

Mostly learned basic skills and knowledge about how to use a laser cutter and by using this what we can make. From last week\u2019s task, I learned how to design with 3d modeling softwares, I used rhinoceros to design my thing to laser cut. I designed a box that opens in the middle like a ring box. When I was about to print my data, I have recognized the material (MDF) was not as thick as I designed.(the wrong information was on the webpage) I almost cried in tears but I truly learned that I have to measure the material before I design. Also, somehow my way of designing intersections was not great, I had to fix it again before cutting. While this happened, Santi told me that he had seen a website that can parametrically generate a box that looks exactly like I designed. That time I did not have enough time for print,(the booking system was messed up and I only had 5 mins to do)I chose to download the generator design and printed it. I don\u2019t think that it was a waste of time because designing is important and teaches us a lot of things, but for the easy prototyping or something like that I would rather choose something open source. Many sad things happened, though I learned a lot too.","title":"03 3rd week Computer controlled cutting"},{"location":"Fabacademy/03-3rd%20week%20Computer-controlled%20cutting/#3rd-week-feb9-computer-controlled-cutting","text":"This week we learned about laser cutting.

I was familiar with 3D printing since uni, though it was my first time printing on my own. I wanted to make my first printing related to the design intervention I am working on. Though I did not come up with any idea and I just thought if I could use this time for mending the cloth, which is a jacket that has lost its button. I modeled a button and booked a 3D printer. I actually booked an Ender for printing, but somehow the booking system was messed up and I was not able to use the one I booked. So I used ANYCUBIC. When I tried to use it, it was not working properly with the configuration. So with the help of Edu I set up the Z axis. I started to print with high quality and the result was nice. These buttons can be used as they are but I wanted to make biomaterial buttons, so I made a mold with silicon and made pine resin bio material. As I knew it is hard to make holes in the buttons with the mold, so I drilled to make holes after biomaterial became solid. Though pine resin biomaterial is still fragile, most of it broke when I made the holes. Only the one that survived was this one and I used it to mend the jacket. It turned out like this and I sewed it to the jacket which had lost its button. It looks very nice.","title":"5th 3D Printing Feb.23"},{"location":"Fabacademy/5th%203D%20Printing%20Feb.23/#5th-3d-printing-feb23","text":"This week we learned how to make a model to data and use 3D printers.

Rei and Emilio were working on the compost intervention, so we easily came to this idea of making part of our intervention related to making a compost toolkit. First Jeremy was also in the group, but eventually separated to do the different things after talking about what we want to make for this challenge. Initial Idea \u00b6 When we started designing, we also had reviews from Guillem, Kate and alumni Pablo for the design intervention and that influenced us to work on this challenge as a prototype for intervention. Since we talked with them, we wanted to develop a compost toolkit sensor that detects some information about the status of the compost such as temperature, humidity, ph, etc.. We discussed focusing on the one feature now to understand how it can be interactive even without using electric sensors, but in an analog way. Gillem advised us to use thermochromic paint which can change its color with the temperature to see how warm the compost gets inside the box. Also to show that and what kind of food waste is thrown away is important because it can lead to the consciousness of waste. We decided to make a transparent compost box for food waste consiousness and making the composting process to be seen Design Process \u00b6 Based on this concept, we decided to build a transparent compost box that has two layers and also has thermochromic features. It is designed for a compost beginner that wants to see what is going on inside and wants to make sure the temperature which indicates the status of compost. 1.Sketch \u00b6 We first drew a sketch, like a really simple one with adding the features. We wanted this compost box with these following features. with a Lid to avoid the smell showing the process air can come in people can look what is inside people can put food waste sieving compost detect temperature change of the compost scaling how much compost decreased 2.Modeling \u00b6 We used Rhinoceros to model. We finalized the design by researching some references. Bio Compostera Digital This is how we finished up designing. As we knew Emilio would leave earlier, so we wanted to keep it simple for Rei to be able to manage everything. It has two layers. The top layer is for decomposing. The bottom layer is used for ready-to-use compost which is sieved from the top layer that has new food waste to decompose. It also dehydrates from the top parts to the bottom. Bottom part can also be used for the plant pot. This compost box can also be a demonstration or exhibition of making awareness of food waste to people because it has a hole on the top so people can look at it. Based on the modeling, we made a cutting data. We made the tolerance for + 0.3 mm. 3.Material \u00b6 Also we wanted to make it transparent to show the inside and the thermochromic color would turn transparent with the heat, so we decided to use acrylic. We actually wanted to use plywood for the back part of the box in order to paint, but there was no plywood that has the same thickness. -3mm Acrylic Board 600x1000mm -thermochromic paint -soil -foodwaste \u203bAll the following is documented by Rei 4. Laser Cutting \u00b6 I tested the joints with acrylic to see how much tolerance should. Then I got to know that it should be less than the thickness of the material because the laser burns it. So I changed the tolerance to -0.1mm. First the parameter was too weak, it did not cut through the board. Then changed the parameter keeping the same power but slower speed. Then it finally cut through. I did the preassembly to make sure if it all fits. It was fine so I then moved to the paint. 5. Paint \u00b6 I used thermochromic paint I bought to apply on the back part of the box. I painted with a brush,(it actually recommended airbrush or spray which I don\u2019t have) I put almost 5 layers by firstly applying the primer on the surface. I also did a test first. It turns transparent when it attaches to something that is 26-31 degrees. I dried it completely and now it is ready to assemble! 6. Assembly \u00b6 I assembled it using a rubber hammer to completely fit the joints. And I put some compost on the top layer. Some soil that is ready to use goes to the bottom . . Now it is ready to use! Learnings \u00b6 -When making cutting data, it is always important to test cut the joints first -When cutting with laser, it is always important to test cut with the parameter -Materials tend to vary the thickness even in the same piece of board -Acrylic is hard to assemble with finger joints that it sometimes cracks the edge -Designing parametrically is necessary for the joint design Next Step \u00b6 Now I placed it on the corner of our class room. So anyone can throw away their food waste from the hole on the lid and mix it with the shovel. It can be interactive as it changes the color on the back part which indicates how active this compost is because active compost increases temperature. I also want to give it to a compost begginer to test how these features can be effective for them to start doing a compose -these features make it easier? Interactive? Understandable? Fun? Based on the reflections to the test, I will develop a new version of a compost box. . .","title":"FabAcademy 1st Challenge Feb.15 18"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%201st%20Challenge%20Feb.15-18/#fabacademy-1st-challenge-feb15-18","text":"Repository is here below: https://github.com/emiliosmith/FabAcademy-challenge by Rei Terauchi & Emilio Smith","title":"FabAcademy 1st Challenge Feb.15-18*"},{"location":"Fabacademy/FabAcademy%201st%20Challenge%20Feb.15-18/#group","text":"We formed a group based on the design intervention.

As everyone gathered for the first time in our classroom, we started to exchange our beliefs that also explains our fight. My Fight \u00b6 My fight is a bit too specific. I explained as I want to design the soil of urban areas using food waste to make compost out of it. Because I have doubts on urban infrastructure that is in a black box, like we will never know what is actually happening behind our scenes of life. This black box situation is leading to people unconscious about making a huge amount of waste in industry or even at home. I am now willing to change that situation and make food waste into some kind of nutrition of cities which can become some food production-urban farming in a future. For that, my keywords will be circular design, soil design, food waste, compost, and urban farming. \u30fb I was able to get to know what everyone is fighting for. \u30fb I was able to look back what I want to do and why I came to IaaC. \u30fb I was able to imagine that I can collaborate with someone when working on a real project in a future. Elisava \u00b6 Elisava tour was interesting as it is so much different from IaaC education and facility. They have basically every kind of machines- laser cutter, CNC router with 3 axis, 3D printers, coping machines, bio-related machines, and so on\u2026 Elisava is somehow so much like \u201cacademia\u201d for me, though I think it is good for me to go both IaaC and Elisava, learning in between them. I was also impressed to see graduation project that each student at Elisava has developed. \u30fb I was able to see the difference between IaaC and Elisava. \u30fb I realized I can use the difference of these two in a good way when learning and making. \u30fb Thesis examples from past year\u2019s students that Oscar showed us really pushed me to work hard. Skills/Knowledge/Altitude \u00b6 Personal vision is something I have never tried to think of before because I had a tiny tiny goal for everything I did that won\u2019t improve me at all. When I thought of it and actually had a meeting with other people to exchange our visions, it somehow improved me to have a real goal I want to achieve every week of our session. \u30fb I was able to think deeply about my vision both as designer and a person. \u30fb Long term vision is hard to make it true but will encourage me. \u30fb It is always important to think about vision because it gives you some hints on your work as well. Gitlab Website \u00b6 Making website using gitlab is pretty hard. Also keeping website active is hard as well. I already have my website that I run with my friends and it is hard to keep it updated, so this is. Git is so confusing but I tried. \u30fb It is always good to update/archive what you\u2019ve up to because this will give you a opportunity to connect with others. \u30fb it is important to reflect what you\u2019ve learnt and archive it in order to improve yourself. Poblenou \u00b6 Poblenou is such an inspiring place. I can find anything nice here. It is said Poblenou 10 years ago was nothing, though these 10 years artists and designers started to move here and became such a lovely neighborhood. I tried to find a flat in Poblenou, though it was kind of expensive and very popular. I hope this place is not going to be like Brooklyn where gentrification has happened after artists started to live.( well I don\u2019t think so) \u30fb Neighbors are good to make community with and collaborate with. \u30fb Making furnitures out of trash happens. \u30fb Mobility is well concerned and its sharing mind is impressing. \u30fb urban farming makes sharing economy, also culture and community. I used to do urban design with research and also a bit of architecture. Somehow there is many people thinking about how to make this place better and really work on it. This means there is many ways I can connect my interest to.

This means there is many ways I can connect my interest to.

Weak signals are analysis of the main change factors that shows certain directions of now day society. Through out the week, we have been introduced to those weak signals and thought about how to connect them to our interests. First, we did this exercise to randomly select a weak signal and make a scenario on how to make a change with it. Afterward, we had to choose one weak signal that we want to think about. Q. Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago? I chose Inter-species Collaboration. It has been my interest for last several years how human beings can live with soil and microorganisms in the soil or air. I had been interested in compost since I did my graduation project on turning food waste into compost at urban infrastructure system combini. (Just as I talked about it as my fight) Since then, I also got interested in soil and microorganisms. As I was impressed by Donna Haraway who says her compost is also her partner in a sense of \u201csignificant others\u201d, I wanted to make that kind of relationship more practical in a city. I actually chose Fight Anthropocene Conflicts as my second weak signal which it is related to the topic of food waste I was also interested about. Also chose Circular Data Economy as my third one as I was interested about how to make everyone involved in a process of making compost using fabrication. Q. Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. As I was too sick to go for a hiking, I did my looking at weak signals in a situated approach through scales exercise in my room. As my weak signal \u201cInter species collaboration\u201d , I could just think something very general. Mostly related to my shopping experience at grocery store, when I choose vegetables and if it is genetically modified or not. Farther more, I recognized this city Barcelona is mostly covered with concrete blocks which means it is hard to see soils, relating this to my interest in soil. It was hard for me to think about a weak signal in national or global situation because my question towards society is always related to my experience in life. Though going through this exercise brought me learn that I need to relate things in larger scale which can be led to a change factor in society. Q. How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? It was such a hard exercise for me. Everyone has chosen close topics, though everyone\u2019s approach and way of thinking is different. For example, someone in my group was interested in making sustainable product because she cares about climate change, though my view towards sustainability is a bit different from hers so we kind of ended up making a board on their own purposes. Our team set our theme as \u201cWhat happens after Product\u2019t life cycle?\u201d, it is okay for me but what I want to think more about is how people can be responsible for product\u2019s life cycle. If we could have more time, we could just talk and explain what we really think about on each topics. Though, I learned there is many ways to approach one single problem in a society because everyone has a different approach. This means I can learn from others so I could have exchanged more about our thoughts just like it was nice that we could exchange some projects that relate. 1. Someone you would like to contact 1.

What we learned in the class was basically the basics of biology and agriculture. We had a lot of hands-on experiments and learning of basic contents. First week we learned about what biology is and the first thing we started off with was growing baterias in a container, which is bacteria we got from around IaaC. I rubbed a tree surface and my iPhone and rubbed medium in a container. As time passes, I have noticed , in this world there are microorganisms/bacterias everywhere. This is why we really need to wash or sanitize our hands now. The other day we learned about spirulina and tried to grow it. Though it is hard to grow it( and it is why spirulina was only growing in specific places in the world). It will be a savior to the world of hunger if many people are really able to grow it everywhere.Though I did not find any difference than taking a capsule of proteins or minerals. We also tried growing our own kombucha in a small pot and learned how fermentation processes. Now a pot is at my home and scoby seems to be growing little by little. Also we learned how to use microscopes and how it works. As we learned how to use microscopes, our perspective also got micro.

It was analyzing how much energy it can create for heating up water and space using an example of a real composting plant. Also it analyzes how much cost we need for it to be competitive with other energy systems, by designing a new way of getting energy from a compost plant. In conclusion, it was both doable and cheaper in comparison to other systems so that heat from compost is a realistic solution for nowadays energy problems.

Though, not many people actually grow plants nor use compost. ( I hope I also want to work on this problem too) Then I found this article that compost makes energy. This paper was talking about the system of making compost energy, though as a designer I want to design something that everyone can get involved in this process of producing energy through composting. Since my objective is why everything around my life is in black box, I think everyone should be more responsible for at least something and they should be involved in the system. This made me think that compost energy can be a tool or platform for people who compost at home and produce energy for their use at home and I now want to design it just like the example of Precious Plastic. Hypothetical Designed Organism \u00b6 As above, I am interested in microorganisms in the compost. It is said effective microorganisms are fermenting bacteria, actinomycetes, and, basidiomycota. You can get them from fallen leaves or organic food waste. Though it is hard to keep them active to make compost hot enough. I guess so I need to design a microorganism that can be fully effective to composting as itself only. I guess mushrooms is something that can most likely to be the one that has those three bacterias.

It is a personal computer , used for personal work like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing. This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies. This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet. It had an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and 3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port This device could be used for personal use or work. ::: Steps taken \u00b6 First of all we checked if the computer worked. It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. We could check that the iMac worked but we couldn\u2019t check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility. We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system. From this step it was all based on the electronic system behind the computer. We disassembled the motherboard and other components such as hard drive, heat sink, CD lector\u2026 Details of some components: Datasheet for the logicboard (motherboard) http://www.barebonekit.net/apple-imac-a1195-820-1960-a-logic-board_i_mballpe8201960a.aspx Results \u00b6 Q.How many motors we find inside, does it contain a computer or microcontroller? 3 motors. It contains a microcontroller. Q.Did the appliance fail, why? It was properly working when we turned it on. Q.Did the appliance failed?Why? This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone. Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use. Conclusions \u00b6 It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in. Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it\u2019s open. There are more than 100 screws used inside. Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both manufactured by stamping, the stand might be molded. Plastic parts(box) are coated polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore. Opinions \u00b6 At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits, so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder The body it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward. There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws. We can also find a few metals for heat displacement like aluminum and copper. There are also tiny plastic parts that make the connection to the back part of the computer and the boards or the optical unit to the lateral of the computer.

Hypothesis: - Lunch&Afternoon Data \u201cThere is a space for a (covid-safe) lunch?\u201d - Morning Data \u201cAre there people in Iaac interested in having a space to have lunch?\u201d Tips \u00b6 We think we needed more time to think about the question we were going to use, so our strategy of how we recollected the data and defining which tool could work so that the results were more efficient. We had two topics, so we generated many different ideas to work with each one, so maybe choosing a general one that could have those two ideas covered, was more convenient. From hypothesis to data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We decided to choose the PiCamera as a tool for the experiment. We thought it would be quite a practical way of checking the availability of IAAC spaces and counting people. However, a physical intervention would have been also an appropriate means to collect data for our case. Tool \ud83d\udd27 usage documentation: \u00b6 We used the PiCamera to create timelapses in two different ways: - POV timelapse: the camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC. - Static timelapse: the camera was static in a specific place and captured everything that happened there. For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px) in order not to have heavy files. We also set the photo frequency to 1 picture per second to have enough information from people\u2019s movements. Data capturing strategy: \u00b6 Our strategy consisted of two main points: The first one was based on checking the different spaces of IAAC with the camera during lunchtime and seeing if there was people eating inside. Thanks to this, we could get information for both of our hypothesis. The second one focused on testing the interest of people around a poster in the entrance communicating a supposed \u201cLunch Room\u201d at IAAC\u2019s main hall. This would let us know about support for this idea. Also, we had to change the strategy in the middle of the data collection since the PiCamera stopped working. Our intention there was to count the amount of people going to eat outside during lunchtime compared to the total of people at IAAC. However, we believe this wasn\u2019t a major problem for our research. Materials needed: \u00b6 Picamera, \u201cLunchRoom\u201d poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms. Detail setup instructions: \u00b6 Data collected \u00b6 Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc. For privacy reasons we are not able to show the images captured by the Raspberry Pi. Two impressions of the data generated shown below. \u201cWhere people are eating lunch inside IAAC building \u201c: \u201cPeople that was interested in the Lunch room poster\u201d: Video recorded with the PiCamera Tips \u00b6 It was hard to analyze what is happening in the captured timelapse data because the camera took pictures every 3 seconds only, so there were things that the camera was not able to capture. Also, we chosed to make the resolution of the data low and it gave us a hard time to analyze things in the timelapse especially for the static one. We would change how the data is captured and output rather than changing how we collect the data.

In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Proving it\u2019s true it will require testing all possible combinations, that\u2019s hard, maybe impossible. ::: Post at least two images of a chart, a screen-shoot of your data, that you used to prove if your hypothesis is false. Tips \u00b6 We think that in order to recollect more data, we have to do it for more days at the same hour (lunch time) because is not precise just knowing how much people had lunch inside Iaac when we know that the quantity may vary depending on the days. And if we want to know the amount of people that enters Iaac and compared it to the people that eats inside for whatever reason, we need to do it for more days. I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lucnh time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"05 Forensic Report & Measuring the World "},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#tech-beyond-the-myth-first-week-nov8-12","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond thE Myth first week Nov.8-12"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#forensic-report-imac-2006","text":"Identity of the reporting agency MDEF Case identifier MDEF//21-22_Tech_beyond_the_myth Identity of the submitter iMac Destructor Date of receipt 09/11/2021 Date of report 09/11/2021 Identity and signature of the examiner Emilio,Fioella,Andrea,Rei","title":"Forensic Report: iMac 2006"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#examination","text":"serial number: CK6s0083WH4 Brand: Apple (in California) Model: A1195 apple computer Color: White Assembled in: China Specifications: 1.83/2x512/160 combo/Esp 2006 Tested: Working :::","title":"Examination"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#forensic-questions","text":"How does it work?

It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. We could check that the iMac worked but we couldn\u2019t check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility. We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system. From this step it was all based on the electronic system behind the computer. We disassembled the motherboard and other components such as hard drive, heat sink, CD lector\u2026 Details of some components: Datasheet for the logicboard (motherboard) http://www.barebonekit.net/apple-imac-a1195-820-1960-a-logic-board_i_mballpe8201960a.aspx","title":"Steps taken"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#results","text":"Q.How many motors we find inside, does it contain a computer or microcontroller? 3 motors.

This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone. Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use.","title":"Results"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#conclusions","text":"It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in. Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it\u2019s open. There are more than 100 screws used inside. Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both manufactured by stamping, the stand might be molded. Plastic parts(box) are coated polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore.","title":"Conclusions"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#opinions","text":"At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits, so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder The body it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward. There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws. We can also find a few metals for heat displacement like aluminum and copper. There are also tiny plastic parts that make the connection to the back part of the computer and the boards or the optical unit to the lateral of the computer.","title":"Opinions"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#eating-space-at-iaac","text":"Measuring the world / A world in data activity report.

Result is I had so much fun. Documentation Firstly we disassembled the machine in order to see what is inside and analyze the maker\u2019s strategies. When we opened the iMac 2006 which was the 2nd generation iMac ever made, we found a lot of Apple\u2019s strategic design. (Which is also capitalism point of view) Basically Apple products are not allowing users to fix or touch product mechanics. They have the point to keep users patient to buy their next products coming out. If a user ever fixes or touches inside their product, Apple will never help supporting them. BUT how do they get to know if a user touches or not? That was what we found inside the iMac, basically everything inside was covered with aluminium sheet and that was for detecting heat and radiation but also for this- because a user cannot see things inside by tearing it. That really made me think Apple is really good at marketing and design for gaining more money from customers. Recently, they have announced that they will be selling some parts for iphones to let users fix by themselves. Though, I still think there are some strategies behind it. First half of the week we also did learn data collecting methods. There are several devices they introduced us to collect data- Smart Citizen Kit, Pi Camera, Light Sensor, and Web Scraping. My group chose a Pi Camera and collected data by placing it at one point and putting it on a body to walk around. My group had these following as a set of ideas.

Sadly my opinion was rejected in the group and so we tried to capture where we can eat by putting the camera on a body to walk around. In the end I kind of realized that a camera is basically only good for capturing at one specific place in order to get precise data.

I first downloaded the free 3d data of arms and basically used the Slicer to make it able to cut by laser. Other parts are processed by other people in the group. What was hard for the process of making is prototyping takes so much time when making data into a physical model. Even if it looked okay in the data, it is actually not in reality. This is why we do prototyping, but still I had used a long time working on it. It was hard to decide the size of the intersection of materials for data.

Group work was okay, my group somehow had people with good skills of techs and programming but this means I am still not understanding the techs( because I did not have to do it) , I might need some time to really learn it.

I have made a biomaterial only once in my life and it was last term I did in my house. It was a failure because I did not calculate each ingredient precisely. Now I know why Lara told us to calculate and write everything down that you put in. Here is what we did in the class and after class for the biomaterial. First of all, I brought a crab shell for the food waste additives. Agar agar \u00b6 How: We selected the additives and grinded 2.Weight and write quantities. 3.we put the fabric sandwiched by the frame 4.we pour water in agar in the pot We put the pot on fire till the boiling point. 6.we put the pot down the fire and put glycerin and vinegar 7.we put the eggshells and pigment 8.we pour the the thing into the frame 9.let it dry 1)eggshells 10 grs. Agar 200 ml. Water 2 ml. Glycerin 2 ml. Vinegar 2 spoons of eggshell 1 pinch of blue powder pigment We chose eggshells for the first try because it was the one that we had for a huge amount. The result was not that beautiful. I was expecting it to be more bright blue, but it seems like gray. I was kind of sad. 2)coffee 10 grs. Agar 200 ml. Water 2 ml. Glycerin 2 ml. Vinegar 2 spoons of coffee We then tried with the coffee which we got tons from a cafeteria. I don\u2019t know why, but it seems to be not that useful when it is dried. Maybe the color is not cool. 3)crab shell 10 grs. Agar 200 ml. Water 2 ml. Glycerin 2 ml. Vinegar 2 spoons of crab shell 1 pinch of red powder pigment This crab shell is what I brought from my house. I didn\u2019t know what to do, but it smells like the sea and stinks. I wanted to get rid of it, but I didn\u2019t know how. Just followed the instructions and the result was fine. But when it dried, it shrank and cracked. Maybe I needed to add more additives. My group has made a mistake to put it on a big mold that did not make liquids enough to reach to the edge otherwise it shrank and cracked after when it is dried. Alginate \u00b6 How: 1.We chose additives and grinded 2.weight and write quantities We prepared the frame with the thick fabric 4.we sprayed the calcium chloride on the frame and fabric We mixed the ingredients except the additives 6.we take some solution with the cylinder 7.we added additives and poured into the frame 8.we sprayed the calcium chloride on the solution We let it dry 1)eggshells 12.5 grs. Alginate 500 ml. Water 30 ml. Glycerin 3 spoons of eggshell 2 pinch of blue powder pigment 1 pinch of unicorn glitter Calcium chloride solution 30 grs. With 500 ml. of H2O It was also that we tried the eggshell with blue pigment. It also turned out gray. Maybe eggshell with blue is not a good combination for the color.I liked how we spray and it turns solid. 2)orange peel 12.5 grs. Alginate 500 ml. Water 30 ml. Glycerin 3 spoons of orange peel 2 pinch of green powder pigment 1 pinch of unicorn glitter Calcium chloride solution 30 grs. With 500 ml. of H2O It was nicer that orange peel adds the color of orange to the biomaterial itself. I like this one the most. Also the bio yarn was fun to make because we gently pushed the cylinder to pour the solution into the calcium chloride. It was a bit difficult for me to keep pushing with the same amount in order to make the yarn the same thickness. I feel like I want to knit something with this. Pine resin \u00b6 How: 1.we chose additives and grinded 2.weight and write quantities 3.we pressed the baking paper on to the mold 4.we put the resin and alcohol in the pot 5.we heated it up until all the resin melt 6.we put the wax to melt 7.we put the pot down from the heat 8.we added additives 9.we pour the solution to the mold 10.we pressed the mold so hard with the baking paper and the lid 1)coffee 45 grs. Pine resin 15 ml. Alcohol 5 grs. Carnauba wax 60 grs. Coffee My group has failed because we put too much coffee which is causing the material to be weak and cracked. 2)eggshell,crabshell,orange peel 45 grs. Pine resin 15 ml. Alcohol 5 grs. Carnauba wax 40 grs. eggshell,crabshell,orange peel This was the last, so we only had a few amount of the additives left except the coffee, so we mixed all the things we had and made one. It turned out orangeish but not that beautiful. I think this pine resin recipe is most useful for making something solid-like a tool. For this pine resin recipe, I kind of learned that the amount of food waste additives differ by the mass of the additives. So after class, when I tried to do it with other molds, I kind of tried to balance to make it not too thick. As we thought this recipe is useful and can make some procult out of it, we decided to develop it by using local wasted additives. Resin Development \u00b6 How: 0.we made a frame with wood. 1.we went to get the additives in the local area and grinded 2.weight and write quantities 3.we pressed the baking paper on to the mold 4.we put the resin and alcohol in the pot 5.we heated it up until all the resin melt 6.we put the wax to melt 7.we put the pot down from the heat 8.we added additives 9.we pour the solution to the mold 10.we pressed the mold so hard with the baking paper and the lid 45 grs. Pine resin 15 ml. Alcohol 5 grs. Carnauba wax 20 grs. Leaves 115 grs. Pine resin 38 ml. Alcohol 12.5 grs. Carnauba wax 75 grs. Flowers This is for the mold we made that can have 1mm thick biomaterial. I still want to figure out how these biomaterials can be solid enough to be a product-like we are trying to make a comb with the recipe above, though it is still too weak to cut out, I think. I want to try making a shovel next time with some food waste biomaterial, I will try to use some other recipe that can stay longer. I mean, I think the idea of biomaterial is for something that does not have to last long. Though I want to make sure if I can make something that lasts longer like a shovel as a product. Also Now I want to try making a fashion item with biomaterial since I realized it is kind of hard to make a solid product with biomaterial. As I saw Suzanne Lee\u2019s bio couture, I want to try making a bioleather. For the cloth I will need a huge container to grow material, but I think for the small accessory like a wallet I can probably try.

Also we wanted to research some practical way for biomaterial rathar than researching material itself. We first tried to make a biomaterial with these flowers in, with a pine resin recipe. We wanted to cut it for a comb shape but literally we cannot use the cnc machine and it can break. Then we changed our mind to make a mold with a laser and pour biomaterial in.

At the time, I also started doing my worm compost in order to compare with aerobic compost that I have been doing. Then I am trying to make a biomaterial shovel as a compost toolkit. I first drew a diagram for the household compost project which I want to archive. Starting from your food waste at home, it is made into compost that can produce so many things. To do this, I need to first try to make a sensor. When I talked with Jonathan and Tomas, they taught us so many references and people that have knowledge and skills for making compost sensors. I contacted them and will be in touch soon. I compared worm compost and aerobic compost by doing both. I did it to design a toolkit that can be used in any kind of compost. I summarized it to see how it differs in the process. It has been only 10days, I can get to know a lot of things. (Recently I have started doing worm compost and Emilio started doing aerobic compost at home!) Rei\u2019s worm compost Emilio\u2019s aerobic compost As a result, it is case by case and depends on what you want for the compost, though It seems that aerobic compost is the easiest and practical for anyone. This comparison shows the sensor should have at least the scale of ph, humidity, temperature, smell features. I think I can also ask the grow observatory what features should be scaled for healthy soil. Also, I am trying to develop a toolkit by using biomaterials that have additives of food waste. Now I make a mold and will try to make a shovel with coffee waste and eggshells. I want to use food waste that can take time to compost for making biomaterial as a part of a toolkit. Last design intervention was a small first step for us that we actually did not design something physical. We had this two workshops to make people more conscious and interested in the compost making as their companion species. We had this idea as a way, in the future, people will need to grow their own food and energy so the compost can be the key source for this coming situation. Also, the important thing is that people should be responsible and explicit about how food is produced and wasted in the current system, which is a black box. We want to open up the black box and let people do something in the system as we are all living together on the earth, co-working with companion species. This intervention, we need to start designing things on hands as we will continue our subject for doing compost. We believe that this circular system has to replace the linear system in which food is distributed nowadays, this linear system takes the user off the source of the food and place it only as a consumer not as a producer, placing them in a passive roll; this roll doesn\u2019t allow to the user to participate in the system actively with the only function of consume and generate waste. No one can be responsible for their food and also waste. Therefore, the user doesn\u2019t realize the amount of resources needed for the production and the resources disposed as waste. In a circular system the waste is perceived as a resource, meaning that people waste could be used to create new soil, land in form of the compost then, to grow their own food, in this system could interact some producers and intermediaries. It can be a design for Anthropocene that we can bring some impacts on the relationship between land and our human bodies. Our purpose now is to empower and facilitate the activity of making a personal compost by making it more interactive, easy and productive through tools, toolkits and devices, and in the other hand create networks and spaces for sharing knowledge\u2019s and co-creates solutions that could improve and nourish and generate new solutions. For the next intervention, we will design a toolkit which mainly focuses on a sensor that has an interface to interact with people and makes the composting process easier so that it can be a daily activity for them. Also, we will design a do-design workshop in order to let compost users test our sensor so we can develop it more in the way they give us feedback.","title":"1PP Design Intervention"},{"location":"project/1PP%20Design%20Intervention/#1pp-design-intervention","text":"For this 1PP intervention, I did some research and summarized my project as doing what I need to do. At the time, I also started doing my worm compost in order to compare with aerobic compost that I have been doing. Then I am trying to make a biomaterial shovel as a compost toolkit. I first drew a diagram for the household compost project which I want to archive. Starting from your food waste at home, it is made into compost that can produce so many things. To do this, I need to first try to make a sensor. When I talked with Jonathan and Tomas, they taught us so many references and people that have knowledge and skills for making compost sensors. I contacted them and will be in touch soon. I compared worm compost and aerobic compost by doing both. I did it to design a toolkit that can be used in any kind of compost. I summarized it to see how it differs in the process. It has been only 10days, I can get to know a lot of things. (Recently I have started doing worm compost and Emilio started doing aerobic compost at home!) Rei\u2019s worm compost Emilio\u2019s aerobic compost As a result, it is case by case and depends on what you want for the compost, though It seems that aerobic compost is the easiest and practical for anyone. This comparison shows the sensor should have at least the scale of ph, humidity, temperature, smell features. I think I can also ask the grow observatory what features should be scaled for healthy soil. Also, I am trying to develop a toolkit by using biomaterials that have additives of food waste. Now I make a mold and will try to make a shovel with coffee waste and eggshells. I want to use food waste that can take time to compost for making biomaterial as a part of a toolkit. Last design intervention was a small first step for us that we actually did not design something physical. We had this two workshops to make people more conscious and interested in the compost making as their companion species. We had this idea as a way, in the future, people will need to grow their own food and energy so the compost can be the key source for this coming situation.

As I was curious about the massive industrial food waste in Japan, I started working at the combini store which is an infrastructure for people in the city, to see the reality. In the system, food waste is reprocessed for livestock feed and they come back to a store as new food. Combini company says it\u2019s a sustainable system but it actually keeps wasting food. Working as a staff\u2000at the combini, I tried to distribute the food waste by reaching out to homeless people and food bank. Though, it failed because dead food had no demand for them. I needed to change the direction of how to reuse the food waste. At the time, I was invited to the little island where people are self-efficient about their food. There I learned about community compost and it can also grow food for them. This compost makes a circulation as well as the connection between the land and their bodies. I started doing compost at home also trying to make this connection and circulation in the city. I proposed the idea to the combini store and had the compost workshop together with the owner and the company manager. Compost can be a medium for the community as well as it can solve the huge food waste problem in the store and produce vegetables in the store. I wanted to make a platform and a system to make it happen. For that I started doing this intervention to make more people engaged in compost making. This is why Emilio and I started our intervention as a companion compost workshop to teach people how making compost has possibilities to survive future urban life. Our goal is to have future citizens presented in the diagram below. Main thing is to grow food and produce energy by making compost. To achieve this goal, we decided to take small steps and the first step was this companion compost making workshops. We did two workshops for this intervention. Emilio\u2019s 5-year-old nephew in the states. Online and made compost together by showing presentation slides and telling them how to do it. MDEF friends in the IaaC class room. Explained why we are doing this intervention and made a compost together. The objective pursued was to design the experience of compost making so that it becomes a habit or personal activity and to be perceived as a companion species for them, besides an opportunity of exploring the personal organic waste. Learning waste is not waste, but it can be the production resource and also doing compost is making your pet-companion species that are living together in your world line. After finishing the workshops, we detect several opportunities to improve the experience, therefore we formulate a design question for continuing the design process. \u00b7 For a better impact it is necessary to have a co-design process in order to design a toolkit that allows any person to engage in the compost making. \u00b7 The personal compost making activity could lead us to a community engagement activity in the form of a sharing resources platform. \u00b7 Our intent after that, would be directed to design an experience that could generate a change in the personality to have more people interested in making positive changes and make compost making a regenerative activity for the future such as toolkit/platform. Next attempt we are going to do is designing a toolkit or interface that attracts people to do it everyday with joy and fun. At the design dialogues exhibition, we have got a lot of feedback on how to make it a daily activity for people at any age and any type of the house. We should make it easy, fun, interactive, smell-less, and space-less. To overcome these important objects, I am going to start off interviewing people who have actually done making compost toolkits. Then we are going to design and do some workshops or probes in order to see how actual compost makers feel about it. At the same time, we are going to open a platform where people can share ideas and fears as well as resources. That might be open for domestic and neighborhood/city level.","title":"Design Dialogue"},{"location":"project/Design%20Dialogue/#design-dialogues","text":"","title":"Design Dialogues"},{"location":"project/Design%20Dialogue/#companion-compost","text":"My intervention arose from my diploma.

First, in the remixing material classI tried to make a fork that can be used for mixing soil with food waste. In the compost project shown in the diagram, I want to pursue the way of reusing food waste which takes a long time to be decomposed, for biomaterials. And with that biomaterial, I want to make a tool(toolkit). I first made a mold with a plywood and laser cutter. Then I made a pine resin based biomaterial with eggshells and a pinch of orange peel to make its color orange. I actually wanted to put a wooden handle, so I put it in the mold but it didn\u2019t stay. I used it for mixing compost and it works, but then I got so many reflections. -It should be hard because it sometimes bent like a gum -It should have had a handle to mix -it should be a bit bigger in size so that it can mix more at a time -it should be a shovel? I will probably refer to the indegenous tools for tool making. Also I have some reflections on the method of making. -the mold should not be complicated shape when using plywood mold -it should not require digital fabrication for making mold -the method and the recipe also should be open source so it should be done with the ingredients that are easily found at supermarket So now I will try to make another shape and way to make a mold with a new recipe I will think of. Maybe using wasted rice can be like glue to make the material harder. I will try. Second, in the fabacademy I made a transparent compost box that shows what is thrown inside and temperature change. In the beginning, I wanted to use sensors for detecting the status of compost, but when talking with Guillem he told me that technology is not always the answer. (Also I am not good at electronics) Then I chose to use a thermochromic paint that changes the color between 26-31 degrees so I can assume how much compost is being active by seeing the color change. I used the laser cutter to make it and it is two layers. Also the material is acrylic, it shows inside and food waste that can lead to waste consciousness for people. Top layer is for composting and the bottom layer is for the soil that is ready to use. The bottom part in the top layer has many holes, so some ready to use compost will be sieved to go down. It can be a pot for planting when there is enough soil inside. I just started to place it in the MDEF class room for classmates to use it and test it, it will be our intervention from now on to see how people would use it. Also then I can make supre if the color change really works and could it be effective for the process. Lastly, I have been in contact with alumni Pablo who had Farmacademyas his project. He is helping me to improve my project and introduced Abonokm0, Miki. I will have a meeting with him next week to see how I can collaborate with him. Also I talked with Oscar Gonzales that he was a part of Grow Observatory. He taught me how this kind of project works and what I should do now. He told me that now I should focus on one feature of the compost -like temperature - if I am making a toolkit to detect the data/status. So that I now concentrate on how to get the temperature change of the compost and how I can make it interactive and fun for people who do the compost.","title":"Design Intervention 2"},{"location":"project/Design%20Intervention%202/#design-intervention-2","text":"For the 2nd intervention, it was not for me to intervene with people, but with materials as I used the fabacademy and remixing materials for the opportunity to prototype.

We interviewed people below. 1)Madrid Community Compost (https://compostajecomunitariohtz.wordpress.com/) They are the group of people who approach the government and engage into the education of teaching how to compost at local elementary schools in Madrid. We basically asked how they manage to be involved at the community level. Also they put a blog about the meeting with us. 2)Emilio\u2019s Design office partner Rebecca She is also a professor at the university where she teaches design. Recently she got this project from the faculty that she and her students researched about how much their university produces waste every day and every year. She then thought about the compost can be a good solution for this and will start some kind of prototypes with her students. She shared that the school in the community can be the hub for waste management in the city. 3)Abonokm0 Miki He is also a guy who charges in connecthort. Pablo introduced him to us. We basically shared what we are doing and came up with a way to think if we could collaborate in some way. Food waste Biomaterial carry bag Since we thought it is also a way to make compost as activities for people to be involved, we started to think of another way of doing compost other than having it at home. Also our classmates asked if they could bring their food waste to the community garden. We decided to develop a carry bag that they can put their food waste inside and throw away the whole thing. So the material should be compostable and obviously we used some organic waste to make it. This time I wanted to try bio leather and this recipe, we used wasted tea leaves for this. I followed this recipe. http://fabtextiles.org/coffee-leather-bag/ Recipe: 12G sodium alginate 12G dried tea leaves 12G oil 30G glycerin 198G water MIX for calcification 7G of calcium chloride in 100ml of water How: 1- Weight all the ingredients with a precision scale. 2- Mix the tea leaves and sodium alginate together with the glycerin and the oil. 3- Add the water and use a mechanical blender to obtain an homogeneous solution. 4- Mix the Calcium chloride with water in a sprayer bottle. 5- Spray the biomaterial on top and bottom with the calcium chloride solution. 6- Cast in a frame. Spread the solution with a spatula to make the surface smooth. 7- Let the calcium chloride act for 5 8- Let the composite sample dry in a dry and warm place. 9- When the product is dry you can separate it from the frame. It is still drying so I have not been trying to sew it yet, but I will try as soon as it dries. I also want to try this one to use a laser for biomaterial and make a bag without sewing. 3.Organic Material Library This is what Julia,Pippa, and Fiorella were developing for the Fabacademy challenge to make an organic matter material list relating to the shelf they made. I asked them if I could join for adding information about compost. I am still researching it but hopefully we can publish it by the end of this term. Rooftop Compost and gardening This is also what we are doing as a group with classmates to make the IaaC rooftop as a continuous experimentation place for especially those who has interest in bio and solar punks. Emilio and I will make a community compost for all IaaC and gardening pots to grow some vegetables using compost. For this, Emilio went to hunt some discarded materials on the street and started seeding some vegetables. As soon as we decide to start, we will work on it. 5.Classroom compost observation Continuing from fabacademy challenge, we have been observing how classmates will use our compost. It seems like they have been putting a lot of compostable cups and trays which they bought at nearby cafes. Also some vegetables and fruit skins. Though it seems like they are not mixing it well, so we out up a poster which explains how to use and what to put, I don\u2019t know if it is working, but it will surely take some time to decompose since it is not increasing the temperature which is indicated by the thermochromic paint. Also by puting real temperature sensor and humidity sensor, it is obvious that it is not warm. I need to think how it can do well. 6.Community engagement in Poblenou As we talked with Tomas Vivianco, we started to think about how we could engage in the community. Like our goal is not to make compost but generate something through compost. We started to interview at the IaaC neighborhood restaurant in Poblenou. We so far asked NOMAD and Galega for how they are dealing with their organic waste.They told us they are just throwing them away into the Barcelona city organic waste bin on the street. They said they don\u2019t separate precisely on what they are throwing away like they mix vegetable peels and leftovers together. If we could have a good relationship to make their industrial waste throw into the compost we make( or not), it would be a circulation in the community which is what we want to archive. Also we started to get in touch with the Maripossas community. It looks like they had a compost before so if we can get in touch about it.","title":"Design Intervention 3"},{"location":"project/Design%20Intervention%203/#design-intervention-3","text":"From the last design intervention, we have been developing several things below though all of them are ongoing. 1.Interviews with compost makers 2.Food waste Biomaterial carry bag 3.Organic Material Library 4.Rooftop Compost and gardening 5.Classroom compost observation 6.Community engagement in Poblenou Interviews with compost makers As we wanted to develop and exchange the knowledge and skills relating to our project, we have been interviewing and communicating with many people.

I have been doing a project with that in mind for past years. Though, my actual interest is not thinking about sustainability nor climate change. What I really want to work on is how to make people be aware and take responsibility of living. I thought about this since I realized everything around us, I mean infrastructure and systems are in black box. We do not know what is behind the scenes. That way people will never stop wasting less. People will never stop engaging in the bad part of capitalism. Even if a system changes in a good way, the same bad things will happen again as long as people in a system realize to change how they should be. So basically this is my position. I have references that are mostly how a designer(or artist) himself/herself goes to see the reality of cases and they find out how to break through it. I want to see the reality of the cases which I want to work on and take actions as understanding the real needs. This reality includes problems, systems, structures and etc. of certain case. Ever since I am more comfortable prototyping with myself engaged, I decided to make my compost first. Hoping this can lead to some other kind of ideas beside making a compost kit. My most preferable prototype method will be \u201cmeans of inquiry\u201d. My research type is always kind of ethnography and I like to do the probes and sometimes interview. In my work space, I chose weak signals that are related to circular economy, sustainability, and inter-species which are the big topics of Anthropocene. My First Prototype \u00b6 Since I was interested in bio related design, I decided to make the bioplastic. I first did the agar-agar one, then tried eggshell one. These are materials I used. Recipe; https://materiom.org/recipe/41 As I followed this recipe to heat the things in a pan and poured the solution into a container. I let them dry for 2 days and it still looks like this. It is not fully dried and still is jelly.I don\u2019t know if I did it differently or if I sit it more it is gonna look like bioplastic. Lt\u2019s see. Recipe;https://materiom.org/recipe/623 As I did using this recipe, I ignored vaccinium myrtillus L (Wild Bilberry powder) which I was not able to buy. I first boiled and dried eggshells then mushed it in little pieces. Rest of the process is similar to the agar-agar one. I mixed solution and eggshell pieces at the end and poured in into a container. Next day when I checked it, it was kind of dried. Still, it seems not smooth because I didn\u2019t mush eggshells enough so it looks bumpy and rough. Maybe I need to buy a grinder.
