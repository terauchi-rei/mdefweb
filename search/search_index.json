Jose Antonio Uribe I like it because this documentation is based on the linear timeline and I can follow how this person got developed through the course. Roger Guilemany Casas I like it because this person basically documents everything. Even there is no challenge, he just writes reflections and that I can see how this person felt and improved through the course. 3. Alejandra Tothill Calvo I like it because this person really does amazing work for the design. The way of documenting is also interesting that this person embeds some sound files. I will start working on html by following the steps that lecturers showed us. Within term 2, I will try my best to archive my webpage by making my own one. For that I am sure to take these examples to develop my idea.","title":"01 1st Week"},{"location":"Fabacademy/01-1st%20Week/#1st-week-jan26","text":"1st week Jan.26 It was the beginning of Fabacademy, which I was waiting for!

I am used to design with rhinoceros for 3d modeling but other software is not practical for me. This time, because we had a blender session, I tried to use it as much as I could. I learned the basics so I am not that skillful to design anything with the blender yet, so I tried first to model the coffee cup which could be the easiest for me now. I rendered by trying to put the materials on each part and lights for the rendering. I watched some tutorial videos on Youtube that gently taught me the basic skills. After learning through the coffee cup modeling, I then tried to model something that relates to my project. I modeled the Compotbot which can be a speculation for my project because I am trying to design a compost toolkit sensor now that detects some important information to keep compost healthy.

As everyone gathered for the first time in our classroom, we started to exchange our beliefs that also explains our fight. My Fight \u00b6 My fight is a bit too specific. I explained as I want to design the soil of urban areas using food waste to make compost out of it. Because I have doubts on urban infrastructure that is in a black box, like we will never know what is actually happening behind our scenes of life. This black box situation is leading to people unconscious about making a huge amount of waste in industry or even at home. I am now willing to change that situation and make food waste into some kind of nutrition of cities which can become some food production-urban farming in a future. For that, my keywords will be circular design, soil design, food waste, compost, and urban farming. \u30fb I was able to get to know what everyone is fighting for. \u30fb I was able to look back what I want to do and why I came to IaaC. \u30fb I was able to imagine that I can collaborate with someone when working on a real project in a future. Elisava \u00b6 Elisava tour was interesting as it is so much different from IaaC education and facility. They have basically every kind of machines- laser cutter, CNC router with 3 axis, 3D printers, coping machines, bio-related machines, and so on\u2026 Elisava is somehow so much like \u201cacademia\u201d for me, though I think it is good for me to go both IaaC and Elisava, learning in between them. I was also impressed to see graduation project that each student at Elisava has developed. \u30fb I was able to see the difference between IaaC and Elisava. \u30fb I realized I can use the difference of these two in a good way when learning and making. \u30fb Thesis examples from past year\u2019s students that Oscar showed us really pushed me to work hard. Skills/Knowledge/Altitude \u00b6 Personal vision is something I have never tried to think of before because I had a tiny tiny goal for everything I did that won\u2019t improve me at all. When I thought of it and actually had a meeting with other people to exchange our visions, it somehow improved me to have a real goal I want to achieve every week of our session. \u30fb I was able to think deeply about my vision both as designer and a person. \u30fb Long term vision is hard to make it true but will encourage me. \u30fb It is always important to think about vision because it gives you some hints on your work as well. Gitlab Website \u00b6 Making website using gitlab is pretty hard. Also keeping website active is hard as well. I already have my website that I run with my friends and it is hard to keep it updated, so this is. Git is so confusing but I tried. \u30fb It is always good to update/archive what you\u2019ve up to because this will give you a opportunity to connect with others. \u30fb it is important to reflect what you\u2019ve learnt and archive it in order to improve yourself. Poblenou \u00b6 Poblenou is such an inspiring place. I can find anything nice here. It is said Poblenou 10 years ago was nothing, though these 10 years artists and designers started to move here and became such a lovely neighborhood. I tried to find a flat in Poblenou, though it was kind of expensive and very popular. I hope this place is not going to be like Brooklyn where gentrification has happened after artists started to live.( well I don\u2019t think so) \u30fb Neighbors are good to make community with and collaborate with. \u30fb Making furnitures out of trash happens. \u30fb Mobility is well concerned and its sharing mind is impressing. \u30fb urban farming makes sharing economy, also culture and community. I used to do urban design with research and also a bit of architecture. Somehow there is many people thinking about how to make this place better and really work on it.

Weak signals are analysis of the main change factors that shows certain directions of now day society. Through out the week, we have been introduced to those weak signals and thought about how to connect them to our interests. First, we did this exercise to randomly select a weak signal and make a scenario on how to make a change with it. Afterward, we had to choose one weak signal that we want to think about. Q. Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago? I chose Inter-species Collaboration. It has been my interest for last several years how human beings can live with soil and microorganisms in the soil or air. I had been interested in compost since I did my graduation project on turning food waste into compost at urban infrastructure system combini. (Just as I talked about it as my fight) Since then, I also got interested in soil and microorganisms. As I was impressed by Donna Haraway who says her compost is also her partner in a sense of \u201csignificant others\u201d, I wanted to make that kind of relationship more practical in a city. I actually chose Fight Anthropocene Conflicts as my second weak signal which it is related to the topic of food waste I was also interested about. Also chose Circular Data Economy as my third one as I was interested about how to make everyone involved in a process of making compost using fabrication. Q. Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. As I was too sick to go for a hiking, I did my looking at weak signals in a situated approach through scales exercise in my room. As my weak signal \u201cInter species collaboration\u201d , I could just think something very general. Mostly related to my shopping experience at grocery store, when I choose vegetables and if it is genetically modified or not. Farther more, I recognized this city Barcelona is mostly covered with concrete blocks which means it is hard to see soils, relating this to my interest in soil. It was hard for me to think about a weak signal in national or global situation because my question towards society is always related to my experience in life. Though going through this exercise brought me learn that I need to relate things in larger scale which can be led to a change factor in society. Q. How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? It was such a hard exercise for me. Everyone has chosen close topics, though everyone\u2019s approach and way of thinking is different. For example, someone in my group was interested in making sustainable product because she cares about climate change, though my view towards sustainability is a bit different from hers so we kind of ended up making a board on their own purposes. Our team set our theme as \u201cWhat happens after Product\u2019t life cycle?\u201d, it is okay for me but what I want to think more about is how people can be responsible for product\u2019s life cycle. If we could have more time, we could just talk and explain what we really think about on each topics. Though, I learned there is many ways to approach one single problem in a society because everyone has a different approach. This means I can learn from others so I could have exchanged more about our thoughts just like it was nice that we could exchange some projects that relate. 1. Someone you would like to contact 1. RemixThe School 2. SISCODE 3. ROMI 4. FOOD SHIFT 2. An experiment you\u2019d like to make 1. I want to try designing a toolkit for helping people make compost in their house in a city.

What we learned in the class was basically the basics of biology and agriculture. We had a lot of hands-on experiments and learning of basic contents. First week we learned about what biology is and the first thing we started off with was growing baterias in a container, which is bacteria we got from around IaaC. I rubbed a tree surface and my iPhone and rubbed medium in a container. As time passes, I have noticed , in this world there are microorganisms/bacterias everywhere. This is why we really need to wash or sanitize our hands now. The other day we learned about spirulina and tried to grow it. Though it is hard to grow it( and it is why spirulina was only growing in specific places in the world). It will be a savior to the world of hunger if many people are really able to grow it everywhere.Though I did not find any difference than taking a capsule of proteins or minerals. We also tried growing our own kombucha in a small pot and learned how fermentation processes. Now a pot is at my home and scoby seems to be growing little by little. Also we learned how to use microscopes and how it works. As we learned how to use microscopes, our perspective also got micro. I feel like I can think about things on a micro scale now so that is how I am now interested in the world of microorganisms in soil. Second week was much about agriculture(+biology combined). What I enjoyed the most is about soil, how it is specified in types and circular systems flows. I was not able to see soil using a microscope, though when I saw it with a digital microscope, even only one scoop of soil had many things in it. I felt it was some kind of galaxy. The lecture ended with bioplastic cooking. My group followed the direction and recipe which was shown by teachers though it did not get thick, it was a failure. Then I noticed even making bioplastic is chemistry and biology. Maybe the formula of each compound was not correct. With that in mind, this bio&agri zero lectures really meant a lot to me. When I make a bioplastic, it really seems to be doing design but it is not. It is chemistry/biology so I need to learn more about it. \u30fb I understood that biology on a different scale could be a different study. \u30fb Microorganisms/bacterias are everywhere so it is good to know that they can be helpful when I design something related to biology. \u30fb In biology, I felt everything natural is based on circulation. \u30fb Agriculture is a tool of survival that human beings have invented to live but even agriculture is in survival now. What do we do? \u30fb Bioplastics are a hot trend now but they also require energy. \u30fb Fermentation is used in daily products especially in food production. Can its process be used for hard things like furniture, architectural material, cloth or etc Scientific Paper Review \u00b6 Energy from Waste: Reuse of Compost Heat as a Source of Renewable Energy summary \u00b6 This paper was estimating if we could use the heart that is created by waste compost, into an energy source. It was analyzing how much energy it can create for heating up water and space using an example of a real composting plant. Also it analyzes how much cost we need for it to be competitive with other energy systems, by designing a new way of getting energy from a compost plant. In conclusion, it was both doable and cheaper in comparison to other systems so that heat from compost is a realistic solution for nowadays energy problems. What I learned \u00b6 I was originally interested in compost since undergrad and had been making compost for the past two years. I was always thinking of how we can actually turn compost into something reusable because there are not many ways to reuse it. Only we can come up with is to use compost as fertilizer. Though, not many people actually grow plants nor use compost. ( I hope I also want to work on this problem too) Then I found this article that compost makes energy. This paper was talking about the system of making compost energy, though as a designer I want to design something that everyone can get involved in this process of producing energy through composting. Since my objective is why everything around my life is in black box, I think everyone should be more responsible for at least something and they should be involved in the system. This made me think that compost energy can be a tool or platform for people who compost at home and produce energy for their use at home and I now want to design it just like the example of Precious Plastic. Hypothetical Designed Organism \u00b6 As above, I am interested in microorganisms in the compost. It is said effective microorganisms are fermenting bacteria, actinomycetes, and, basidiomycota. You can get them from fallen leaves or organic food waste. Though it is hard to keep them active to make compost hot enough. I guess so I need to design a microorganism that can be fully effective to composting as itself only. I guess mushrooms is something that can most likely to be the one that has those three bacterias. Mushrooms are growing as they are biodegrading organic stuff around it by using enzymes they are producing. Mushrooms are basidiomycota. If I put them in water for several days to start fermentation, would they have both fermenting bacteria and actinomycetes?","title":"03 Bio&Agri Zero"},{"location":"Term1/03-Bio%26Agri%20Zero/#bioagri-zero-oct19-29","text":"These last two weeks we have been exploring the possibilities of biology and agriculture especially in the design field.

It was hard for me to come up with an idea that I can put it into a form.First I collected some garbage from outside the IaaC and Brough them to the class. It actually looks like something I cannot use since its like some junks of wall blocks, so I changed my mind to use some other garbage in the class. It actually was hard for me house something not around me to make something out of it, this way I had a hard time figuring out what to make. I kind of started out just making something random and finally got the idea in the end when I asked other people\u2019s machines. Though I had in mind that I wanted to make something that relates to collaboration. It is my group\u2019s machines. I was surprised almost everyone did make a machine that interacts with people. My group was first set the idea of \u201cbehavior change\u201d as our main theme of post consumerism so I guess we all are interested in how people actually act and how to collaborate with them.

It is a personal computer , used for personal work like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing. This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies. This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet. It had an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and 3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port This device could be used for personal use or work. ::: Steps taken \u00b6 First of all we checked if the computer worked. It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. We could check that the iMac worked but we couldn\u2019t check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility. We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system. From this step it was all based on the electronic system behind the computer. We disassembled the motherboard and other components such as hard drive, heat sink, CD lector\u2026 Details of some components: Datasheet for the logicboard (motherboard) http://www.barebonekit.net/apple-imac-a1195-820-1960-a-logic-board_i_mballpe8201960a.aspx Results \u00b6 Q.How many motors we find inside, does it contain a computer or microcontroller? 3 motors.

This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone. Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use. Conclusions \u00b6 It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in. Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it\u2019s open. There are more than 100 screws used inside. Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both manufactured by stamping, the stand might be molded. Plastic parts(box) are coated polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore. Opinions \u00b6 At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits, so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder The body it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward. There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws.

Eating Space at IAAC \ud83c\udf5d \u00b6 Measuring the world / A world in data activity report. Andrea | D\u00eddac | Kai | Rei | Ruben Journal Index Tech Beyond thE Myth first week Nov.8-12 Forensic Report: iMac 2006 Examination Forensic Questions Steps taken Results Conclusions Opinions Eating Space at IAAC \ud83c\udf5d From objectives to the hypothesis Brainstorming Project Goals Tips From hypothesis to data Tools selection Tool \ud83d\udd27 usage documentation: Data capturing strategy: Materials needed: Detail setup instructions: Data collected Tips Data capture Data summary Data insights Tips From objectives to the hypothesis \u00b6 Brainstorming \u00b6 Multiple images about the brainstorming process: Project Goals \u00b6 Objective: I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC. Question: Are all spaces in IAAC in use at lunch time? Hypothesis: - Lunch&Afternoon Data \u201cThere is a space for a (covid-safe) lunch?\u201d - Morning Data \u201cAre there people in Iaac interested in having a space to have lunch?\u201d Tips \u00b6 We think we needed more time to think about the question we were going to use, so our strategy of how we recollected the data and defining which tool could work so that the results were more efficient. We had two topics, so we generated many different ideas to work with each one, so maybe choosing a general one that could have those two ideas covered, was more convenient. From hypothesis to data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We decided to choose the PiCamera as a tool for the experiment. We thought it would be quite a practical way of checking the availability of IAAC spaces and counting people. However, a physical intervention would have been also an appropriate means to collect data for our case. Tool \ud83d\udd27 usage documentation: \u00b6 We used the PiCamera to create timelapses in two different ways: - POV timelapse: the camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC. - Static timelapse: the camera was static in a specific place and captured everything that happened there. For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px) in order not to have heavy files. We also set the photo frequency to 1 picture per second to have enough information from people\u2019s movements. Data capturing strategy: \u00b6 Our strategy consisted of two main points: The first one was based on checking the different spaces of IAAC with the camera during lunchtime and seeing if there was people eating inside. Thanks to this, we could get information for both of our hypothesis. The second one focused on testing the interest of people around a poster in the entrance communicating a supposed \u201cLunch Room\u201d at IAAC\u2019s main hall. This would let us know about support for this idea. Also, we had to change the strategy in the middle of the data collection since the PiCamera stopped working. Our intention there was to count the amount of people going to eat outside during lunchtime compared to the total of people at IAAC. However, we believe this wasn\u2019t a major problem for our research. Materials needed: \u00b6 Picamera, \u201cLunchRoom\u201d poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms. Detail setup instructions: \u00b6 Data collected \u00b6 Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc. For privacy reasons we are not able to show the images captured by the Raspberry Pi. Two impressions of the data generated shown below. \u201cWhere people are eating lunch inside IAAC building \u201c: \u201cPeople that was interested in the Lunch room poster\u201d: Video recorded with the PiCamera Tips \u00b6 It was hard to analyze what is happening in the captured timelapse data because the camera took pictures every 3 seconds only, so there were things that the camera was not able to capture. Also, we chosed to make the resolution of the data low and it gave us a hard time to analyze things in the timelapse especially for the static one. We would change how the data is captured and output rather than changing how we collect the data. Data capture \u00b6 Data summary \u00b6 Data Summary Project Title Where people are eating lunch inside IaaC building Capture Start 11-11-2021 Capture End 11-11-2021 Original Data Format Timelapse mp4 Submitted format CSV file Total Data Points 28 Number of datasets 1 Data Repository https://github.com/fablabbcn/mdef-a-world-in-data/blob/main/eating-space-at-iaac/spaceforlunchtime.csv Data Summary Project Title People that was interested in the Lunch room poster Capture Start 12-11-2021 Capture End 12-11-2021 Original Data Format Timelapse mp4 Submitted format CSV file Total Data Points 6 Number of datasets 1 Data Repository https://github.com/fablabbcn/mdef-a-world-in-data/blob/main/eating-space-at-iaac/peopleinterestedinposter.csv Data insights \u00b6 :::warning A hypothesis may be testable, but even that isn\u2019t enough for it to be a scientific hypothesis. In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false. Proving it\u2019s true it will require testing all possible combinations, that\u2019s hard, maybe impossible. ::: Post at least two images of a chart, a screen-shoot of your data, that you used to prove if your hypothesis is false. Tips \u00b6 We think that in order to recollect more data, we have to do it for more days at the same hour (lunch time) because is not precise just knowing how much people had lunch inside Iaac when we know that the quantity may vary depending on the days. And if we want to know the amount of people that enters Iaac and compared it to the people that eats inside for whatever reason, we need to do it for more days. I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lucnh time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"05 Forensic Report & Measuring the World "},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#tech-beyond-the-myth-first-week-nov8-12","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond thE Myth first week Nov.8-12"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#forensic-report-imac-2006","text":"Identity of the reporting agency MDEF Case identifier MDEF//21-22_Tech_beyond_the_myth Identity of the submitter iMac Destructor Date of receipt 09/11/2021 Date of report 09/11/2021 Identity and signature of the examiner Emilio,Fioella,Andrea,Rei","title":"Forensic Report: iMac 2006"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#examination","text":"serial number: CK6s0083WH4 Brand: Apple (in California) Model: A1195 apple computer Color: White Assembled in: China Specifications: 1.83/2x512/160 combo/Esp 2006 Tested: Working :::","title":"Examination"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#forensic-questions","text":"How does it work?

However, we believe this wasn\u2019t a major problem for our research.","title":"Data capturing strategy:"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#materials-needed","text":"Picamera, \u201cLunchRoom\u201d poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms.","title":"Materials needed:"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#detail-setup-instructions","text":"","title":"Detail setup instructions:"},{"location":"Term1/05-Forensic%20Report%20%26%20Measuring%20the%20World%20/#data-collected","text":"Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc. For privacy reasons we are not able to show the images captured by the Raspberry Pi.

And if we want to know the amount of people that enters Iaac and compared it to the people that eats inside for whatever reason, we need to do it for more days. I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lucnh time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"Tips"},{"location":"Term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/","text":"Tech Beyond thE Myth first week Nov.8-20 \u00b6 These last two weeks have been about techs which I thought I would have a tough time. Result is I had so much fun. Documentation Firstly we disassembled the machine in order to see what is inside and analyze the maker\u2019s strategies. When we opened the iMac 2006 which was the 2nd generation iMac ever made, we found a lot of Apple\u2019s strategic design. (Which is also capitalism point of view) Basically Apple products are not allowing users to fix or touch product mechanics. They have the point to keep users patient to buy their next products coming out. If a user ever fixes or touches inside their product, Apple will never help supporting them. BUT how do they get to know if a user touches or not? That was what we found inside the iMac, basically everything inside was covered with aluminium sheet and that was for detecting heat and radiation but also for this- because a user cannot see things inside by tearing it. That really made me think Apple is really good at marketing and design for gaining more money from customers. Recently, they have announced that they will be selling some parts for iphones to let users fix by themselves. Though, I still think there are some strategies behind it. First half of the week we also did learn data collecting methods. There are several devices they introduced us to collect data- Smart Citizen Kit, Pi Camera, Light Sensor, and Web Scraping. My group chose a Pi Camera and collected data by placing it at one point and putting it on a body to walk around. My group had these following as a set of ideas.

At the time, I also started doing my worm compost in order to compare with aerobic compost that I have been doing. Then I am trying to make a biomaterial shovel as a compost toolkit. I first drew a diagram for the household compost project which I want to archive. Starting from your food waste at home, it is made into compost that can produce so many things. To do this, I need to first try to make a sensor. When I talked with Jonathan and Tomas, they taught us so many references and people that have knowledge and skills for making compost sensors. I contacted them and will be in touch soon. I compared worm compost and aerobic compost by doing both. I did it to design a toolkit that can be used in any kind of compost. I summarized it to see how it differs in the process. It has been only 10days, I can get to know a lot of things. As a result, it is case by case and depends on what you want for the compost, though It seems that aerobic compost is the easiest and practical for anyone. This comparison shows the sensor should have at least the scale of ph, humidity, temperature, smell features. I think I can also ask the grow observatory what features should be scaled for healthy soil. Also, I am trying to develop a toolkit by using biomaterials that have additives of food waste. Now I make a mold and will try to make a shovel with coffee waste and eggshells. I want to use food waste that can take time to compost for making biomaterial as a part of a toolkit. Last design intervention was a small first step for us that we actually did not design something physical. We had this two workshops to make people more conscious and interested in the compost making as their companion species. We had this idea as a way, in the future, people will need to grow their own food and energy so the compost can be the key source for this coming situation. Also, the important thing is that people should be responsible and explicit about how food is produced and wasted in the current system, which is a black box. We want to open up the black box and let people do something in the system as we are all living together on the earth, co-working with companion species. This intervention, we need to start designing things on hands as we will continue our subject for doing compost. We believe that this circular system has to replace the linear system in which food is distributed nowadays, this linear system takes the user off the source of the food and place it only as a consumer not as a producer, placing them in a passive roll; this roll doesn\u2019t allow to the user to participate in the system actively with the only function of consume and generate waste. No one can be responsible for their food and also waste. Therefore, the user doesn\u2019t realize the amount of resources needed for the production and the resources disposed as waste. In a circular system the waste is perceived as a resource, meaning that people waste could be used to create new soil, land in form of the compost then, to grow their own food, in this system could interact some producers and intermediaries. It can be a design for Anthropocene that we can bring some impacts on the relationship between land and our human bodies. Our purpose now is to empower and facilitate the activity of making a personal compost by making it more interactive, easy and productive through tools, toolkits and devices, and in the other hand create networks and spaces for sharing knowledge\u2019s and co-creates solutions that could improve and nourish and generate new solutions. For the next intervention, we will design a toolkit which mainly focuses on a sensor that has an interface to interact with people and makes the composting process easier so that it can be a daily activity for them. Also, we will design a do-design workshop in order to let compost users test our sensor so we can develop it more in the way they give us feedback.","title":"1PP Design Intervention"},{"location":"project/1PP%20Design%20Intervention/#1pp-design-intervention","text":"For this 1PP intervention, I did some research and summarized my project as doing what I need to do.

I contacted them and will be in touch soon. I compared worm compost and aerobic compost by doing both. I did it to design a toolkit that can be used in any kind of compost. I summarized it to see how it differs in the process. It has been only 10days, I can get to know a lot of things. As a result, it is case by case and depends on what you want for the compost, though It seems that aerobic compost is the easiest and practical for anyone. This comparison shows the sensor should have at least the scale of ph, humidity, temperature, smell features. I think I can also ask the grow observatory what features should be scaled for healthy soil. Also, I am trying to develop a toolkit by using biomaterials that have additives of food waste. Now I make a mold and will try to make a shovel with coffee waste and eggshells. I want to use food waste that can take time to compost for making biomaterial as a part of a toolkit. Last design intervention was a small first step for us that we actually did not design something physical. We had this two workshops to make people more conscious and interested in the compost making as their companion species. We had this idea as a way, in the future, people will need to grow their own food and energy so the compost can be the key source for this coming situation. Also, the important thing is that people should be responsible and explicit about how food is produced and wasted in the current system, which is a black box. We want to open up the black box and let people do something in the system as we are all living together on the earth, co-working with companion species. This intervention, we need to start designing things on hands as we will continue our subject for doing compost. We believe that this circular system has to replace the linear system in which food is distributed nowadays, this linear system takes the user off the source of the food and place it only as a consumer not as a producer, placing them in a passive roll; this roll doesn\u2019t allow to the user to participate in the system actively with the only function of consume and generate waste. No one can be responsible for their food and also waste. Therefore, the user doesn\u2019t realize the amount of resources needed for the production and the resources disposed as waste. In a circular system the waste is perceived as a resource, meaning that people waste could be used to create new soil, land in form of the compost then, to grow their own food, in this system could interact some producers and intermediaries. It can be a design for Anthropocene that we can bring some impacts on the relationship between land and our human bodies. Our purpose now is to empower and facilitate the activity of making a personal compost by making it more interactive, easy and productive through tools, toolkits and devices, and in the other hand create networks and spaces for sharing knowledge\u2019s and co-creates solutions that could improve and nourish and generate new solutions. For the next intervention, we will design a toolkit which mainly focuses on a sensor that has an interface to interact with people and makes the composting process easier so that it can be a daily activity for them. Also, we will design a do-design workshop in order to let compost users test our sensor so we can develop it more in the way they give us feedback.","title":"1PP Design Intervention"},{"location":"project/Design%20Dialogue/","text":"Design Dialogues \u00b6 Companion Compost \u00b6 My intervention arose from my diploma. As I was curious about the massive industrial food waste in Japan, I started working at the combini store which is an infrastructure for people in the city, to see the reality. In the system, food waste is reprocessed for livestock feed and they come back to a store as new food. Combini company says it\u2019s a sustainable system but it actually keeps wasting food. Working as a staff\u2000at the combini, I tried to distribute the food waste by reaching out to homeless people and food bank. Though, it failed because dead food had no demand for them. I needed to change the direction of how to reuse the food waste. At the time, I was invited to the little island where people are self-efficient about their food. There I learned about community compost and it can also grow food for them. This compost makes a circulation as well as the connection between the land and their bodies. I started doing compost at home also trying to make this connection and circulation in the city. I proposed the idea to the combini store and had the compost workshop together with the owner and the company manager. Compost can be a medium for the community as well as it can solve the huge food waste problem in the store and produce vegetables in the store. I wanted to make a platform and a system to make it happen. For that I started doing this intervention to make more people engaged in compost making. This is why Emilio and I started our intervention as a companion compost workshop to teach people how making compost has possibilities to survive future urban life. Our goal is to have future citizens presented in the diagram below. Main thing is to grow food and produce energy by making compost. To achieve this goal, we decided to take small steps and the first step was this companion compost making workshops. We did two workshops for this intervention. Emilio\u2019s 5-year-old nephew in the states. Online and made compost together by showing presentation slides and telling them how to do it. MDEF friends in the IaaC class room. Explained why we are doing this intervention and made a compost together. The objective pursued was to design the experience of compost making so that it becomes a habit or personal activity and to be perceived as a companion species for them, besides an opportunity of exploring the personal organic waste. Learning waste is not waste, but it can be the production resource and also doing compost is making your pet-companion species that are living together in your world line. After finishing the workshops, we detect several opportunities to improve the experience, therefore we formulate a design question for continuing the design process. \u00b7 For a better impact it is necessary to have a co-design process in order to design a toolkit that allows any person to engage in the compost making. \u00b7 The personal compost making activity could lead us to a community engagement activity in the form of a sharing resources platform. \u00b7 Our intent after that, would be directed to design an experience that could generate a change in the personality to have more people interested in making positive changes and make compost making a regenerative activity for the future such as toolkit/platform. Next attempt we are going to do is designing a toolkit or interface that attracts people to do it everyday with joy and fun. At the design dialogues exhibition, we have got a lot of feedback on how to make it a daily activity for people at any age and any type of the house. We should make it easy, fun, interactive, smell-less, and space-less. To overcome these important objects, I am going to start off interviewing people who have actually done making compost toolkits. Then we are going to design and do some workshops or probes in order to see how actual compost makers feel about it. At the same time, we are going to open a platform where people can share ideas and fears as well as resources. That might be open for domestic and neighborhood/city level.","title":"Design Dialogue"},{"location":"project/Design%20Dialogue/#design-dialogues","text":"","title":"Design Dialogues"},{"location":"project/Design%20Dialogue/#companion-compost","text":"My intervention arose from my diploma.

I have been doing a project with that in mind for past years. Though, my actual interest is not thinking about sustainability nor climate change. What I really want to work on is how to make people be aware and take responsibility of living. I thought about this since I realized everything around us, I mean infrastructure and systems are in black box. We do not know what is behind the scenes. That way people will never stop wasting less. People will never stop engaging in the bad part of capitalism. Even if a system changes in a good way, the same bad things will happen again as long as people in a system realize to change how they should be. So basically this is my position. I have references that are mostly how a designer(or artist) himself/herself goes to see the reality of cases and they find out how to break through it. I want to see the reality of the cases which I want to work on and take actions as understanding the real needs. This reality includes problems, systems, structures and etc. of certain case. Ever since I am more comfortable prototyping with myself engaged, I decided to make my compost first. Hoping this can lead to some other kind of ideas beside making a compost kit. My most preferable prototype method will be \u201cmeans of inquiry\u201d. My research type is always kind of ethnography and I like to do the probes and sometimes interview. In my work space, I chose weak signals that are related to circular economy, sustainability, and inter-species which are the big topics of Anthropocene. My First Prototype \u00b6 Since I was interested in bio related design, I decided to make the bioplastic. I first did the agar-agar one, then tried eggshell one. These are materials I used. Recipe; https://materiom.org/recipe/41 As I followed this recipe to heat the things in a pan and poured the solution into a container. I let them dry for 2 days and it still looks like this. It is not fully dried and still is jelly.I don\u2019t know if I did it differently or if I sit it more it is gonna look like bioplastic. Lt\u2019s see. Recipe;https://materiom.org/recipe/623 As I did using this recipe, I ignored vaccinium myrtillus L (Wild Bilberry powder) which I was not able to buy. I first boiled and dried eggshells then mushed it in little pieces. Rest of the process is similar to the agar-agar one. I mixed solution and eggshell pieces at the end and poured in into a container. Next day when I checked it, it was kind of dried. Still, it seems not smooth because I didn\u2019t mush eggshells enough so it looks bumpy and rough. Maybe I need to buy a grinder. Next, I want to try throwing them away into a compost and see how my bioplastic is going to be biodegraded.","title":"Design Space"},{"location":"project/Design%20Space/#my-first-prototype","text":"Since I was interested in bio related design, I decided to make the bioplastic.
